# Hello, world!

Let's make sure everything works. Open your favorite text editor and put in these lines:

```funky
func main : IO =
    println "Hello, world!";
    quit
```

Now hit the command line and type this:

```
$ funkycmd hello.fn
Hello, world!
```

There we go!

It should work. If it doesn't, go back and see if you set everything up correctly. If you did and it still doesn't work, [file an issue](https://github.com/faiface/funky).
