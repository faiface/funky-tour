<p><a href="https://github.com/faiface/funky">Funky</a> is a new, small programming language that's like and unlike any other language you've seen before.</p>
<p>It's purely functional, doesn't cheat, but unlike most languages in this space, Funky lets you structure your code top to bottom. Idiomatic Funky code often reads like a well-written imperative algorithm. This lends code that is natural to read - yet in the end, it's basically just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">λ-calculus</a>.</p>
<p>Funky aims for simplicity and joy. No categories, no monads, no weird abstract math operators. Nothing unnecessary. Funky is a pragmatic language for programmers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A small warning.</strong> Funky was created from <em>scratch</em>. While the standard, battle-tested, functional core, like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>Maybe</code>, etc. will be familiar to all functional programmers, many things will surprise you. For example, as we'll soon discover, <code>let</code> and <code>if</code> are not built-in to the language. Instead, they're functions just like any other. Many more surprises await you in the tour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, here we go!</p>

<a class="header" href="#installing" id="installing"><h1>Installing</h1></a>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> These instructions are for Linux. If you're on another operating system, you can try to follow them doing analogous actions on your OS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funky is currently implemented in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and there are no pre-compiled binaries provided yet.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step is to install the Go language either from the <a href="https://golang.org/">official website</a> or from your package manager.</p>
<p>Go uses <code>$GOPATH</code> directory to download packages and install Go programs. If you installed a recent version of Go, you don't have to set it up, it defaults to <code>~/go</code>.</p>
<p>Next you need to download Funky. You do that with the Go package manager:</p>
<pre><code>$ go get -u github.com/faiface/funky/...
</code></pre>
<p>This downloads Funky repository to the <code>$GOPATH/src</code> directory and installs the binaries to the <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> directory.</p>
<p>To make the binaries easily runnable from the command line, you need to add <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> (or <code>~/go/bin</code> if <code>$GOPATH</code> is not set) to the <code>$PATH</code> environment variable. Add this to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file (or an equivalent of that for your shell):</p>
<pre><code># replace $GOPATH with /home/yourname/go if $GOPATH is not set up
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Now, one last thing. Funky uses the <code>$FUNKY</code> environment variable to indentify the location of the standard library. Add this to your <code>.bashrc</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>export FUNKY=$GOPATH/src/github.com/faiface/funky/stdlib
</code></pre>
<p><strong>And that's it!</strong> Let's get ready for some action!</p>
<a class="header" href="#hello-world" id="hello-world"><h1>Hello, world!</h1></a>
<p>Let's make sure everything works. Open your favorite text editor and put in these lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Now hit the command line and type this:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd hello.fn
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>There we go!</p>
<p>It should work. If it doesn't, go back and see if you set everything up correctly. If you did and it still doesn't work, <a href="https://github.com/faiface/funky">file an issue</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#expressions-and-types" id="expressions-and-types"><h1>Expressions and types</h1></a>
<p>Funky is a strongly typed language. To explore types, Funky provides a <em>types sandbox</em>. It's kind of like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>, but it doesn't evaluate anything - just tells you the types.</p>
<p>Here's how we fire it up:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> <code>funkycmd -types</code> currenty doesn't implement convenient things like 'arrow up' to go back to the previous entry, and so on. To get those, I highly recommend using the <code>rlwrap</code> utility. Just install it and run <code>rlwrap funkycmd -types</code> and you'll get all those convenient features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It opens up a little prompt where we can type expressions. Let's try it!</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; 5
Int
&gt; 3.14
Float
&gt; pi
Float
&gt; 'x'
Char
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> Funky has three built-in types: <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Char</code>. <code>Int</code>s are arbitrary-precision integers. <code>Float</code>s are IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers. <code>Char</code>s are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters. All other types are either from the standard library or defined by the programmer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about using some operators and functions?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 13 + 48
Int
&gt; sqrt 4
sandbox:1:6: type-checking error
</code></pre>
<p>Ugh, what? A <em>type-checking error</em>? Yeah, that's right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>. The compiler error messages will get better and more descriptive.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt; sqrt
Float -&gt; Float
&gt; 4
Int
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the type of the <code>sqrt</code> function is <code>Float -&gt; Float</code> (a function that takes a <code>Float</code> and returns a <code>Float</code>), while the value we supplied is an <code>Int</code>. This doesn't match. Instead, we need to supply a <code>Float</code> value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sqrt 4.0
Float
</code></pre>
<p>Now this works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> There are many built-in functions for each of these built-in types. Arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>%</code>), comparison operators (<code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>), math functions (<code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, <code>atan2</code>, etc.), and conversion functions (<code>float</code>, <code>int</code>, etc.). One notable thing is that you can't add characters - <code>'a' + 'b'</code> is not valid - but you can add an integer to a character: <code>'a' + 2</code> results in <code>'c'</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Unary minus is not spelled <code>-</code>, but <code>neg</code>. The reason is that <code>-</code> is always infix because of its name. You can still use <code>-</code> in number literals, like <code>-42</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#printing-various-values" id="printing-various-values"><h2>Printing various values</h2></a>
<p>We've already printed <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code>, how about printing other stuff? Let's try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println 13;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Try running it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd hello.fn
hello.fn:2:13: type-checking error
</code></pre>
<p>A type-checking error again? Let's see where we went wrong. Start up the types sandbox:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And let's examine the type of the <code>println</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; println
String -&gt; IO -&gt; IO
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, so the <code>println</code> function only takes strings. Could've guessed that!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Althought it might not seem like it at first, <code>println</code> is a completely pure function. It takes two arguments: a <code>String</code> and an <code>IO</code>. The <code>IO</code> is a continuation - it says what should be done after the string gets printed. In our case, the continuation is <code>quit</code> (which has the type <code>IO</code> itself). This <em>instructs</em> the program to quit after printing the string. The precise workings of this will be explained soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how do we convert an <code>Int</code> or a <code>Float</code> to a <code>String</code> so that we can print it?</p>
<p>The <code>string</code> function is for that purpose. Let's see what's the type of this <code>string</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; string
Int -&gt; String
Float -&gt; String
Bool -&gt; String
Char -&gt; String
String -&gt; String
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> <code>Bool</code> and <code>String</code> are not built-in, they're implemented in the standard library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what? The <code>string</code> function has multiple types? That's exactly correct!</p>
<p>Unlike most functional languages, Funky supports <strong>overloading</strong>. That means that you can define many functions with the same name, provided they are <em>distinguishible</em> by their types.</p>
<p>Back to the printing. This now works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println (string 13);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Runs as expected:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd hello.fn
13
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Play with various functions. Try operators like <code>*</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>%</code>, math functions like <code>sqrt</code>, <code>sin</code>, <code>log</code>, booleans <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, string functions <code>++</code>, <code>*</code>, and so on. The types sandbox tells you what exists and what types it has.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#semicolons-and-lambdas" id="semicolons-and-lambdas"><h1>Semicolons and lambdas</h1></a>
<p>You've probably noticed the semicolon we used in the previous part and wondered what that's for. Its meaning is actually very simple. It's used to <strong>separate the last argument</strong> to a function <em>without</em> the need to put it in parentheses. Let's see. Say we have an expression like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">string (sqrt 4.0 + sqrt 9.0)
</code></pre>
<p>We can omit the parentheses and use the semicolon instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">string; sqrt 4.0 + sqrt 9.0
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> If you're familiar with Haskell, you'll notice that the semicolon is just like Haskell's <code>$</code> operator. That's correct. Funky uses the semicolon instead of the dollar to avoid clutter, because it's used very frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The semicolon becomes very useful when structuring code. We could write this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println &quot;A&quot; (println &quot;B&quot; (println &quot;C&quot; quit))
</code></pre>
<p>That's a completely valid code that prints three lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd abc.fn
A
B
C
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explanation.</strong> If you're having trouble understand the code above, here's an explanation. The <code>IO</code> is a data structure that describes what the program should do. The simplest <code>IO</code> value is <code>quit</code>. It simply instructs the program to quit.</p>
<p>The type of the <code>println</code> function is <code>String -&gt; IO -&gt; IO</code>. That means that <code>println</code> takes two arguments, a <code>String</code> and an <code>IO</code>, and evaluates to an <code>IO</code>. The resulting <code>IO</code> describes a program that first prints the provided string, then does whatever the second argument says.</p>
<p>Let's look at the inner-most (last) usage of <code>println</code> in the above code: <code>println &quot;C&quot; quit</code>. This expression of type <code>IO</code> describes a program that prints the string <code>&quot;C&quot;</code> and then quits. Since it is an <code>IO</code>, we can pass it as the second argument to another <code>println</code> and we get <code>println &quot;B&quot; (println &quot;C&quot; quit)</code>. And using the same technique once again, we end up with the code above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, we have a lot of parentheses there! Let's get rid of them with those semicolons:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println &quot;A&quot;; println &quot;B&quot;; println &quot;C&quot;; quit
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> We technically don't need the last semicolon as <code>quit</code> is just a single word, but we'll leave it there for <em>style</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, we can split it into mutliple lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println &quot;A&quot;;
    println &quot;B&quot;;
    println &quot;C&quot;;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Now that's cool! It's got lines, it's got semicolons, looks just like an imperative code! Of course, I'm joking a bit here, but it's not that bad, is it?</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-if-function" id="the-if-function"><h2>The <code>if</code> function</h2></a>
<p><strong>Booleans</strong> have type <code>Bool</code>, two values - <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> - and a handy <code>if</code> function for making a choice. What's its type? The beloved types sandbox comes to rescue:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; if
Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>The little <code>a</code> is a type variable. You can replace it with any type whatsoever and <code>if</code> will conform to that type. Of course, you must replace all occurences of <code>a</code> consistently. So <code>if</code> can be used as <code>Bool -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, or as <code>Bool -&gt; IO -&gt; IO -&gt; IO</code>, but <strong>not</strong> as <code>Bool -&gt; Int -&gt; IO -&gt; Float</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>if</code> function checks whether the condition (the first argument) is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If it's <code>true</code>, the second argument is returned. Otherwise, the third argument is returned. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; if true 1 3            # evaluates to 1
Int
&gt; if (4 &lt; 1) &quot;YES&quot; &quot;NO&quot;  # evaluates to &quot;NO&quot;
List Char
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Comments start with the <code>#</code> symbol. Also notice that <code>String</code> and <code>List Char</code> are synonyms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combining the <code>if</code> function with the semicolon, we create an <em>if, else if, else</em> chain:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">if (guess &gt; correct) &quot;Less.&quot;;
if (guess &lt; correct) &quot;More.&quot;;
&quot;Correct!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Isn't this beautiful? A single function suitable both for a one-line choices and for a series of mutually exclusive branches.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lambdas" id="lambdas"><h2>Lambdas</h2></a>
<p>Funky has a very concise syntax for anonymous functions. That's crucial because just like semicolons, anonymous functions are used all over the place. Here's how you write them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">\variable result
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. A backslash, the name the variable, and an expression to evaluate to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important.</strong> All identifiers in Funky are allowed to contain almost arbitrary Unicode characters. That's because tokens are generally separated by whitespace. The only exceptions are the symbols <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>{</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>\</code>, and <code>#</code> that are always parsed as separate tokens.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>idiomatic naming</strong> in Funky is very similar to the one in LISP. Dashes <code>are-used</code> instead <code>of_underscores</code>, functions returning <code>Bool</code> (predicates) usually end with the <code>?</code> symbol, and partial functions (those that can crash) end with the <code>!</code> symbol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Functions of multiple arguments are just functions that take the first argument and return a function taking the rest of the arguments (currying):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">\x \y x + y
</code></pre>
<p>Funky uses <strong>lazy evaluation</strong>. That means that arguments to functions are only evaluated when their value is needed. For example, the factorial of 20 is never calculated here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(\n 3) (factorial 20)  # evaluates to 3
</code></pre>
<p>Also, the factorial of 10 is only computed once, not twice here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(\n n + n) (factorial 10)
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#the-let-function" id="the-let-function"><h2>The <code>let</code> function</h2></a>
<p>The <code>let</code> function? Not a <code>let</code> keyword? Let's verify this:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; let
a -&gt; (a -&gt; c) -&gt; c
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> It really should be <code>a -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; b</code>. Will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhm, so <code>let</code> takes a value and a function. Yep, and then it passes the value to the function and evaluates to whatever the function evaluates to. Maybe a bit hard to understand, so let's see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println (string; let 7 (\x x + x));
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>See that <code>let 7 (\x x + x)</code> there? From what I've said, <code>let</code> should pass the <code>7</code> to the <code>(\x x + x)</code> function and thus the program should print <code>14</code>. And in fact that's exactly what happens:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd let.fn
14
</code></pre>
<p>But as you've probably guessed, this is not the idiomatic use of <code>let</code>. Let's take a closer look:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">let 7 (\x x + x)
</code></pre>
<p>That's pretty ugly! There's one syntactic feature, though, that we haven't talked about yet. If a lambda is the last argument to a function, which it is in our case, we can drop the parentheses. Like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">let 7 \x x + x
</code></pre>
<p>And what now? Split it into multiple lines!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">let 7 \x
x + x
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's starting to look like something. It looks like we've assigned the value <code>7</code> to the variable <code>x</code> and then went on to the next code. And that's precisely how we should think about it. In fact, we can restructure our little program above like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let 7 \x
    println (string; x + x);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the type of the <code>let</code> function got specialized to <code>Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; IO) -&gt; IO</code>, but the result is the same.</p>
<p>So, that's how you assign variables in Funky.</p>
<a class="header" href="#a-bit-more-about-io" id="a-bit-more-about-io"><h1>A bit more about IO</h1></a>
<p>Funky has an unusual approach to side-effects. There's no notion of them in the language itself. What looked like side-effecting functions in the previous sections (<code>println</code>, <code>quit</code>, etc.) were in fact data structure constructors. The <code>IO</code> type is <em>not magic</em> at all. It's just a plain data structure defined in the Funky language itself. Here's its definition (you can also find it in the standard library in the <code>cmd</code> folder):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union IO = quit | putc Char IO | getc (Char -&gt; IO)
</code></pre>
<p>We haven't covered <code>union</code> yet but think algebraic data types (e.g. <code>data</code> in Haskell). This <code>IO</code> data structure serves as a description of what the program should do. However, in contrast with the control flow of traditional imperative languages, the <code>IO</code> data structure can be arbitrarily manipulated - e.g. it's no problem to implement input/ouput encryption just by implementing a single <code>IO -&gt; IO</code> function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The <code>IO</code> data structure is very limited. All it can express is printing and scanning characters. The thing we haven't talked about yet is that <code>funkycmd</code> is just one of the many possible <em>side-effect interpreters</em>. Specifically, <code>funkycmd</code> interprets (executes) the above <code>IO</code> data structure. There's another interpreter called <code>funkygame</code> that interprets an entirely different data structure which describes sprite-based games. You can actually make your own side-effect interpreter fairly easily. The specifics of that are explained in <a href="4-3-building-an-own-side-effect-interpreter.html">another part</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>IO</code> looks like a linked list with two kinds of nodes (not counting <code>quit</code>). The <code>funkycmd</code> interpreter loads the <code>main</code> function, walks the <code>IO</code> nodes, and does as they say.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the nodes individually.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>quit</code></strong>. We've seen this one before - it marks the end of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>putc</code></strong>. This node has two arguments: a <code>Char</code> and an <code>IO</code>. The <code>Char</code> is the character to be printed. The <code>IO</code> tells what should be done next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>getc</code></strong>. Now this one looks strange. It has one argument: a function. The function takes a <code>Char</code> and returns an <code>IO</code>. Here's how <code>funkycmd</code> deals with <code>getc</code>: Upon encountering the <code>getc</code> node, <code>funkycmd</code> scans a character from the standard input. Then it takes the function under <code>getc</code> and applies it to the scanned character, passes it inside. The function gives back an <code>IO</code>. This <code>IO</code> tells what should be done next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's see them in action!</p>
<p>How about a very exciting program that reads a character and prints it back?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    getc (\c putc c quit)
</code></pre>
<p>Run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd getcputc.fn
x
x
</code></pre>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, we can structure the code better using the same tricks we used with <code>if</code> and <code>let</code>. How does this look?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    getc \c
    putc c;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that's nice! The first line scans a character, the second line prints it back, the third line quits the program.</p>
<p>Wait, what would happen if we made it recursive? What if we replaced <code>quit</code> with <code>main</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    getc \c
    putc c;
    main
</code></pre>
<p>By the looks of it, this program should print back all of its input - it's the <code>cat</code> program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> But it never quits! Or does it? Currently, <code>funkycmd</code> is made to silently quit when encountering the EOF, so the program quits correctly. Of course, this behavior is not guaranteed to be kept.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-funky">$ funkycmd cat.fn
hello, cat!
hello, cat!
do you cat?
do you cat?
you do cat!
you do cat!
^D
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>^D</code> sequence at the end is the EOF.</p>
<a class="header" href="#scanning-more-than-one-character" id="scanning-more-than-one-character"><h2>Scanning more than one character</h2></a>
<p>The standard library gives us many goods. There's <code>print</code> and <code>println</code> that work by expanding to multiple <code>putc</code> nodes. Are there some analogous high-level functions for scanning? Sure there are! They're called, how unexpected, <code>scan</code> and <code>scanln</code>. What are their types:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; scan
(String -&gt; IO) -&gt; IO
&gt; scanln
(String -&gt; IO) -&gt; IO
</code></pre>
<p>Oh nice, so their type is the same as the type of <code>getc</code>, except the <code>Char</code> is changed to <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>scanln</code> function scans a whole line and gives it back to you (not including the newline character). The <code>scan</code> function is a little more clever: it reads the next &quot;word&quot; from the input - it skips all the whitespace and captures a continuous string of non-whitespace characters.</p>
<p>We'll get to use <code>scan</code> more in the next section. Here's some <code>scanln</code> for the taste:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    print &quot;What's your name? &quot;;
    scanln \name
    println (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>And there we go:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd greeting.fn
What's your name? Michal Štrba
Hello, Michal Štrba!
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#putting-it-together-a-calculator" id="putting-it-together-a-calculator"><h1>Putting it together: a calculator</h1></a>
<p>We've covered a few basic functions, now we'll put them to the test! We'll make a little calculator. The program is simple but nicely demonstrates how all the functions we've talked about work <em>together</em>. Let's see!</p>
<p>The calculator will work something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd calculator.fn
2 + 2
4
9 / 2
4.5
12 * 12
144
</code></pre>
<p>It will support four operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>. It will only support one operator per expression.</p>
<p>The first thing will be to scan the expression. The expression consists of three words on a single line, so it'll be best to use <code>scan</code> three times:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    scan \x-str
    scan \op
    scan \y-str
    # TODO
</code></pre>
<p>Good. Now, <code>x-str</code> and <code>y-str</code> are strings, because that's what <code>scan</code> gives us. In order to perform computations, we need to convert them to floats first.</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; float
Int -&gt; Float
String -&gt; Float
</code></pre>
<p>The second overload of the <code>float</code> function seems to be doing just that, so let's use it (there's an analogous function for integers called <code>int</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    scan \x-str
    scan \op
    scan \y-str
    let (float x-str) \x
    let (float y-str) \y
    # TODO
</code></pre>
<p>We saved the converted numbers in the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables.</p>
<p>Now we need to compute the result and print it. For example, if the operator is <code>+</code>, the result will be <code>string; x + y</code>. Here we can exploit the <code>if</code> function's ability to form if/else chains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">if (op == &quot;+&quot;) (string; x + y);
if (op == &quot;-&quot;) (string; x - y);
if (op == &quot;*&quot;) (string; x * y);
if (op == &quot;/&quot;) (string; x / y);
&quot;invalid operator: &quot; ++ op
</code></pre>
<p>The last line becomes the result if the operator is not among the supported ones. Now that we've got the result, all that's left it to print it and continue the loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    scan \x-str
    scan \op
    scan \y-str
    let (float x-str) \x
    let (float y-str) \y
    println (
        if (op == &quot;+&quot;) (string; x + y);
        if (op == &quot;-&quot;) (string; x - y);
        if (op == &quot;*&quot;) (string; x * y);
        if (op == &quot;/&quot;) (string; x / y);
        &quot;invalid operator: &quot; ++ op
    );
    main
</code></pre>
<p><strong>And that's it!</strong> Now go and experiment yourself! When you come back, we'll start learning about making our own functions and types.</p>
<a class="header" href="#making-the-world-our-own" id="making-the-world-our-own"><h1>Making the world our own</h1></a>
<p>Until now, you've been learning about a few established functions and concepts in the Funky programming language. <strong>Now we'll learn how to create our own!</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="#functions" id="functions"><h1>Functions</h1></a>
<p>So far, we've only seen one function defined: the <code>main</code> function. But even from that alone I'm sure you've already guessed how function definitions look. They're quite simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func name : type = body
</code></pre>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>The <strong>name</strong> can be any string of non-whitespace characters excluding keyword symbols like parentheses, a backslash, a semicolon, and a few others.</p>
<p>The <strong>type</strong> specifies the type that the function name will aquire.</p>
<p>The <strong>body</strong> is an arbitrary Funky expression, functions, lambda, etc. can be used. The only limitation is that it must conform to the type.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> Let's talk a bit about types.</p>
<p>As we've already learned, there are three built-in types: <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Char</code>. There are also a few types from the standard library, such as <code>Bool</code>, or <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>Then there are types that take other types as arguments - a types that are, so called, generic. The <em>most important</em> of such generic types is the function type. This is also actually built-in, but since it's a type constructor, rather than a full, distinct type, I haven't included it among the built-in types previously.</p>
<p>The function type constructor is called 'the arrow', written as: <code>-&gt;</code>. It takes two arguments, the input type on the left and the output type on the right. For example, <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code> is a function that takes an <code>Int</code> and evaluates to a <code>Bool</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, let's define a function! Every functional language tutorial <em>must</em> include a factorial example, so let's get that behind us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func factorial : Int -&gt; Int =
    \n
    if (n &lt;= 0) 1;
    n * factorial (n - 1)

func main : IO =
    print &quot;Type a number: &quot;;
    scanln \n-str
    let (int n-str) \n
    println (string; factorial n);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>A standard, well known, recursive factorial definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> In Funky it's a convention to put arguments on the next line after <code>=</code> in the function definition. If the function is very short, this convention may be broken and the whole definition may sit on a single line.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> The order of definitions doesn't matter. A function doesn't have to be 'defined before use'. All that matters is that it is defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd factorial.fn
Type a number: 5
120
</code></pre>
<p>If it gives <code>120</code> for <code>5</code> then it surely works. Let's try something bigger:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd factorial.fn
Type a number: 99
933262154439441526816992388562667004907159682643816214685929638952175999932299156089414639761565182862536979208272237582511852109168640000000000000000000000
</code></pre>
<p>Whoa, that's a number! You can try entering even bigger inputs, but don't go too big... you may freeze your system.</p>
<p><strong>Now, how about functions with multiple arguments?</strong> Say we want to make a function called <code>divides</code> that tells us whether one integer divides another or not.</p>
<p>In Funky, as in many other functional languages, there are no functions of more than one argument. Instead, there are functions that return functions. A function of two arguments really is a function that takes the first argument and returns a new function. This new function remembers the first argument and takes the second one.</p>
<p>What would be the type of such a function?</p>
<p>The type <code>Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Bool)</code> would do. It takes the first <code>Int</code>, evaluates to a function taking the second <code>Int</code> and finally evaluates to <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Great, now how would we call such a function?</p>
<p>Using <code>(divides 9) 3</code> would obviously work. But, we don't really need the parentheses. If parentheses are not present, they're implicitly from the left, so <code>divides 9 3</code> is good too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the parentheses in the type <code>Int -&gt; (Int -&gt; Bool)</code> aren't needed either. Since <code>-&gt;</code> is used infix, it's automatically parenthesized from the right, so <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool</code> is equivalent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> There are two kinds of functions in Funky: prefix and infix. Infix functions can be identified easily: they don't contain any letters. All other functions are prefix.</p>
<p>Applications of prefix functions are automatically parenthesized from the left if no explicit parenthesis are present. In all cases, <code>f x y</code> is the same as <code>(f x) y</code>.</p>
<p>Applications of infix functions are, however, automatically parenthesized from the right. All of them have the same precedence. This is to simplify programmer's life: when defining own infix functions, you won't be bothered by specifying precedence levels or associativity. So, <code>3 * 2 + 1</code> is equivalent to <code>3 * (2 + 1)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After learning about automatic parentheses (also called left/right-associativity), here's the definition of <code>divides</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func divides : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool =
    \m \n
    (n % m) == 0
</code></pre>
<p>The body is just two lambdas nested inside one another, which perfectly reflects the type.</p>
<p>We could've also called the function <code>/?</code>, in which case it would be an infix function. However, the name <code>divides</code> is much more descriptive.</p>
<p><strong>Function types may also contain type variables</strong>. These are distinguished from actual types by being all lower-case. Actual types must contain an upper-case character - type variables must not.</p>
<p>When a function has a type variable in its type, that means that this function is fine with whatever type instead of that variable. For example, there's this (probably controversialy named function, usually it's called <code>id</code>) function called <code>self</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; self
a -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't do anything. It just returns whatever it was passed. For example, <code>self 4</code> is <code>4</code>. Now, when we passed <code>4</code> to <code>self</code>, its type changed a bit. It specialized. It became <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>. See? We get this specialization just by replacing <code>a</code> with <code>Int</code> in the type. That's how type variables work.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overloading" id="overloading"><h2>Overloading</h2></a>
<p>Words in natural language usually don't have just one meaning: &quot;If only there was a <em>way</em> we could continue that <em>way</em>, we could've been <em>way</em> ahead of them, but in a <em>way</em>, we haven't done so bad.&quot; The previous sentence used four different meanings of the word 'way'.</p>
<p>Using same words for different, or slightly different meanings in different contexts allows for very concise and expressive speach. Imagine that we'd have to invent a brand new word every time we'd like to add a new meaning to an existing word. That would be cumbersome and unnatural.</p>
<p>Programming is no different. When designing Funky, I realized that support for function overloading brings so many benefits that I couldn't ignore it despite the initial difficulty of implementation.</p>
<p>So, let's try it!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func double : Int -&gt; Int =
    \x x * 2

func double : Float -&gt; Float =
    \x x * 2.0

func main : IO =
    println (string; double 9);
    println (string; double 4.3);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, two versions of <code>double</code>: one for <code>Int</code>s, one for <code>Float</code>s. Let's run it!</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd double.fn
18
8.6
</code></pre>
<p>Works like charm!</p>
<p>Now, how about defining two functions like this?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func zero : Int = 0

func zero : Float = 0.0

func main : IO =
    println (string zero);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>This time, both versions of <code>zero</code> fit the context because <code>string</code> works for both <code>Int</code>s and <code>Float</code>s. What does the type checker say?</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd zeros.fn
zeros.fn:6:21: ambiguous, multiple admissible types:
  Int
  Float
</code></pre>
<p>That's right, the type checker complains. We can fix this error with a type annotation. You can add an explicit type to any expression using the <code>:</code> symbol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func zero : Int = 0

func zero : Float = 0.0

func main : IO =
    println (string (zero : Int));
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>All is fine this time:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd zeros.fn
0
</code></pre>
<p>Well, okay, those two <code>zero</code> functions are distinguishible by their type. But what if we put the same type?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func lucky-number : Int = 7
func lucky-number : Int = 3

func main : IO =
    println (string lucky-number);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Which one gets printed? <code>7</code> or <code>3</code>? Make your guesses, ladies and gentlement...</p>
<p>Here's what happens:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd lucky-number.fn
lucky-number.fn:2:27: function lucky-number with colliding type exists: test.fn:1:27
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, no! It didn't even let us define the second function, because its type collides with the first one.</p>
<p><strong>Funky doesn't let you overload a function if its type collides with an existing version.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> When exactly do two types collide?</p>
<p>Do these two functions collide?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func weirdo : a -&gt; a     = self
func weirdo : Int -&gt; Int = (* 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Indeed, they do! You might argue that the second one is more specific than the first one, so if both fit the context, the second one should be selected, but this doesn't fly in Funky, because it brings a whole bag of problems.</p>
<p>Instead, I chose simplicity: <strong>two types collide whenever their type variables can be substituted such that they become the same type</strong>.</p>
<p>For example: <code>a -&gt; Int</code> collides with <code>Float -&gt; a</code> (substitutes to <code>Float -&gt; Int</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#records" id="records"><h1>Records</h1></a>
<p>Now onto creating our own types!</p>
<p>I'm sure you're familiar with <code>struct</code>s from C or <code>record</code>s from Pascal. They simply group multiple values into a single value. Records in Funky are very much the same.</p>
<p>They're defined like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Name = field : type, ...
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Person =
    name : String,
    age  : Int,
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Trailing comma is allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>Person</code> type is now a new, non-reproductive way of creating people (pretty revolutionary if you think about it). How do we create one?</p>
<p>Whenever we define a <code>record</code>, Funky <strong>generates a constructor function with the same name</strong>. Let's see!</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types person.fn
&gt; Person
String -&gt; Int -&gt; Person
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, it takes values for the name and the age and gives us a fully fledged person. Great!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Person =
    name : String,
    age  : Int,

func main : IO =
    let (Person &quot;Joe&quot; 28) \joe
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>We've got Joe! How do we use him?</p>
<p>In addition to the constructor function, Funky <strong>generates two functions per field: a getter and an updater</strong>. Name of both of the functions is the same as the name of the field:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types person.fn
&gt; name
Person -&gt; String
(String -&gt; String) -&gt; Person -&gt; Person
</code></pre>
<p>The type <code>Person -&gt; String</code> is the getter. It works just as you'd expect:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Person =
    name : String,
    age  : Int,

func main : IO =
    let (Person &quot;Joe&quot; 28) \joe
    println (name joe);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Running it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd person.fn
Joe
</code></pre>
<p>The updater with the type <code>(String -&gt; String) -&gt; Person -&gt; Person</code> is a little more... funky.</p>
<p>Here's what it does: it takes a function and a person. It returns a new person that is the same as the old one, except with the field modified by the function.</p>
<p>Let's see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Person =
    name : String,
    age  : Int,

func main : IO =
    let (Person &quot;Joe&quot; 28)       \joe
    let (name (++ &quot;, yo!&quot;) joe) \joe  # shadows the previous joe variable
    println (name joe);
    let (age (+ 1) joe) \joe          # Joe had a birthday!
    println (string; age joe);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>And run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd person.fn
Joe, yo!
29
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> If you want to replace the field's value by some other value, you can use the <code>const</code> function like this: <code>name (const &quot;Joseph&quot;) joe</code> (changes the name to <code>&quot;Joseph&quot;</code>). The function <code>const</code> makes a function that, taking any input, always evaluates to a constant. So, <code>(const &quot;Joseph&quot;) 12</code> evaluates to <code>&quot;Joseph&quot;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#composing-getters-and-updaters" id="composing-getters-and-updaters"><h2>Composing getters and updaters</h2></a>
<p>The signatures of the getters and the updaters are not random. They enable some really cool stuff! We'll check it out now.</p>
<p>I'll show it to you on these two records:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Point =
    x : Int,
    y : Int,

record Line =
    from : Point,
    to   : Point,
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, now, say we have a <code>Point</code>, let's call it <code>pt</code>. To get the X coordinate we do <code>x pt</code> and to get the Y coordinate we do <code>y pt</code>. Easy! To move the X coordinate 10 units to the right, we do <code>x (+ 10) pt</code> and to set the Y coordinate to 0 we do <code>y (const 0) pt</code>.</p>
<p>Okay, now say we have <code>Line</code>. Let's call it <code>line</code>. The <code>line</code> has two points: <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>. What if we want to move the X coordinate of the first point by 10?</p>
<p>Now, here comes the cool part! All we need to do it to realize, that</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">x (+ 10)
</code></pre>
<p>is a partial application of the <code>x</code> updater and has type <code>Point -&gt; Point</code>. But, any <code>Point -&gt; Point</code> can be used in the <code>from</code> updater:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">from (x (+ 10)) line
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, we can clean it up with the function composition operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(from . x) (+ 10) line
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The function composition operator <code>.</code> works like this: <code>(f . g) x = f (g x)</code>. So you see we've just rewritten the previous expression using this formula.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> In Funky, the function composition operator is overloaded a few times in the standard library, namely for when the second function takes multiple arguments. For example, one of the overloaded versions works like this: <code>(f . g) x y = f (g x y)</code>. That way, writing <code>(concat . map)</code> works exactly as you'd like to. The type checker can always tell which version fits the context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's it! That's pretty clean, isn't it?</p>
<p>Getters can be composed similarly, except in the opposite order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(y . to) line
</code></pre>
<p>That's the Y coordinate of the last point.</p>
<p>Getters and updaters also have a very important role when it comes to expressing state flow with the <code>State</code> type as we'll cover in <a href="3-3-isn&#x27;t-colon-equals-imperative.html">the part about expressing imperative algorithms</a>. In short, they enable record fields to act as mutable variables in an imperative algorithm.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unions" id="unions"><h1>Unions</h1></a>
<p>The second way of creating <em>new</em> types is unions. While a record is a collection of fields, a union defines multiple alternative forms.</p>
<p>Here's the general form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Name = alternative argument ... | ...
</code></pre>
<p>The three dots after <code>argument</code> mean that a single alternative can contain any number of arguments (fields) and the three dots after <code>|</code> mean that a union can have any number of alternatives.</p>
<p>Unlike records, arguments for alternatives have no names, only types.</p>
<p>Here's a simple union:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Bool = true | false
</code></pre>
<p>This is the actual definition of the type <code>Bool</code> from the standard library. The alternatives have no arguments in this case.</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Point = x : Float, y : Float

union Shape =
    line Point Point   |
    circle Point Float |
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Trailing <code>|</code> is allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>Shape</code> type has two alternatives: the <code>line</code> alternatives, which is composed of two points, and the <code>circle</code> alternatives, which has a point (the center) and a float (the radius).</p>
<p>When we define a union, Funky <strong>generates a constructor function for each alternative</strong>. The function simply takes all the arguments in order. Let's check them out!</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types shapes.fn
&gt; line
Point -&gt; Point -&gt; Shape
&gt; circle
Point -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
&gt; line (Point 1.0 8.0) (Point 12.5 -4.9)
Shape
&gt; circle (Point 0.0 0.0) 7.0
Shape
</code></pre>
<p>They definitely work!</p>
<p><strong>To examine a <code>Shape</code> value and make a decision based on whether it's a line or a circle, Funky provides the <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code> construct.</strong> It's best shown by an example. Here's a function that calculates the length of a line or a circumference of a circle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func length : Shape -&gt; Float =
    \shape
    switch shape
    case line \from \to
        hypot (x to - x from) (y to - y from)
    case circle \center \radius
        2.0 * pi * radius
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The <code>hypot</code> function stands for 'hypotenuse' and is used for calculating the length of the long side of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem: <code>hypot x y = sqrt ((x ^ 2.0) + (y ^ 2.0))</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code> construct begins with the <code>switch</code> keyword followed by the value we're switching on. After that, we see a series of <code>case</code> branches. Each branch starts with the <code>case</code> keyword followed by the name of the alternative. That is followed by a function that takes the arguments to the alternative and evaluates to the overall result.</p>
<p>Of course, all <code>case</code> branches must evaluate to the same type: <code>Float</code>, in our case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Currently, all alternatives must be present in <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code> and they must be listed in the same order as they are in the definition of the union. This will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The names of the alternatives can also be infix</strong> if they don't contain any letters. When they are infix, they can be placed between their arguments in the definition.</p>
<p>For example, here's a nice, recursive union for building up arithmetic expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Expr =
    num Int     |
    Expr + Expr |
    Expr * Expr |
</code></pre>
<p>It's either just a number, like <code>num 12</code>, or it's an addition, or a multiplication: <code>num 12 + num 7</code>, or <code>(num 1 + num 9) * ((num 4 + num 3) + (num 2 * num 2))</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The alternatives can be called <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> without a problem thanks to overloading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To evaluate an expression like that, we make use of <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code> again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func eval : Expr -&gt; Int =
    \expr
    switch expr
    case num
        self
    case (+) \left \right
        eval left + eval right
    case (*) \left \right
        eval left * eval right
</code></pre>
<p>Have you noticed that no lambda comes after <code>case num</code>? That's because the <code>case</code> bodies need not explicitly contain lambdas, all they need is a function. In this case, <code>self</code> (the identity function) is the right choice because it just evaluates to the number under <code>num</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see if <code>eval</code> works right!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Expr =
    num Int     |
    Expr + Expr |
    Expr * Expr |

func eval : Expr -&gt; Int =
    \expr
    switch expr
    case num
        self
    case (+) \left \right
        eval left + eval right
    case (*) \left \right
        eval left * eval right

func main : IO =
    let ((num 1 + num 9) * ((num 4 + num 3) + (num 2 * num 2))) \expr
    println (string; eval expr);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>And run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd expr.fn
110
</code></pre>
<p>Works great!</p>
<a class="header" href="#type-variables-in-types" id="type-variables-in-types"><h2>Type variables in types</h2></a>
<p>So far we've only defined types that were concrete, with no type variables anywhere. But it's also possible (and very useful) to define <em>generic types</em>: types parameterized by one or more type variables.</p>
<p>It's really simple.</p>
<p>All we need to do is to list the type variables after the name of the type in the definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Pair a b =
    first  : a,
    second : b,
</code></pre>
<p>That's an actual definition of the <code>Pair</code> type from the standard library.</p>
<p>Or here's another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Maybe a = none | some a
</code></pre>
<p>That is, likewise, the definition of the <code>Maybe</code> type from the standard library.</p>
<p>This way, <code>Pair</code> and <code>Maybe</code> don't define a single type each. Instead, each defines a family of types: <code>Pair Int Float</code>, <code>Pair String Bool</code>, <code>Maybe (String -&gt; String)</code>, <code>Maybe (Pair Int Int)</code> all belong to those families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> 'Type family' is not a concept in Funky, it's just a phrase we use to talk about types. <code>Pair</code> without its type variables filled in is always an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#aliases" id="aliases"><h1>Aliases</h1></a>
<p>Aliases are sooo simple! Too simple. All they do is they define <strong>a new name for an existing type</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">alias Name = type
</code></pre>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> type is an alias:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">alias String = List Char
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, <code>String</code> and <code>List Char</code> are perfect synonyms.</p>
<p>Of course, aliases <strong>can also contain type variables</strong> and have one interesting, although not very useful feature: <strong>they can be recursive</strong>. I haven't found a situation yet where a recursive alias would be needed, but I'll leave that up to you. ;)</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-other-half-of-the-language" id="the-other-half-of-the-language"><h1>The other half of the language</h1></a>
<p>If you've read everything up until this point in the tour, <strong>you know the whole language</strong>! Does it feel like it? Probably not. The language itself feels kinda empty. There isn't much there. You can make functions, types, apply functions, and well, that's about it.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we'll learn how these simple building blocks are put together to build &quot;the rest of the language&quot; in the standard library.</strong></p>
<a class="header" href="#for-loop-is-a-function" id="for-loop-is-a-function"><h1>For loop is a function</h1></a>
<p><em>Lists</em>. They are the butter and bread of functional programming and possibly my favorite data structure ever.</p>
<p>This is how they are defined in the standard library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union List a = empty | a :: List a
</code></pre>
<p>It's a trivial linked list, which means you can't access elements randomly, you always have to traverse them in order.</p>
<p>As you can see, lists can either be empty, or have a first element and a rest of the list. Using the <code>::</code> constructor repeatedly allows for creating longer and longer lists:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">empty
1 :: empty
1 :: 2 :: empty
1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: 6 :: 7 :: empty
</code></pre>
<p>And using recursion, one can even create infinite ones:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func one-two-three : List Int = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: one-two-three
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't enter an infinite loop because Funky is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazily evaluated language</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, typing colons all the time would be tiresome, and so Funky provides a nice syntax sugar with the usual square brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Expands to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">&quot;a&quot; :: &quot;b&quot; :: &quot;c&quot; :: &quot;d&quot; :: empty
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=well%20actually">Well, actually</a>... since the <code>String</code> type is defined as <code>List Char</code>, the string literals must also get expanded to colons, right? Yep, so the full expansion actually is this monstrosity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">('a' :: empty) :: ('b' :: empty) :: ('c' :: empty) :: ('d' :: empty) :: empty
</code></pre>
<p>After seeing this, I'm sure you're way more grateful for all the string and list syntax sugar than you've ever been before.</p>
<a class="header" href="#some-basic-list-functions" id="some-basic-list-functions"><h2>Some basic list functions</h2></a>
<p>With lists comes the legacy of tools, perfected and sharpened for long generations.</p>
<p>The most basic and important ones are <code>empty?</code>, <code>first!</code> and <code>rest!</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; empty?
List a -&gt; Bool
&gt; first!
List a -&gt; a
&gt; rest!
List a -&gt; List a
</code></pre>
<p>The REPL will print more version of the <code>empty?</code> function, but the one listed here is the important one. The functions are simple: <code>empty?</code> tells if a list is empty, <code>first!</code> returns the first element of the list, and <code>rest!</code> cuts off the first element and returns what remains. All other list functions can be implemented in terms of these three (or in terms of <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> Functions <code>first!</code> and <code>rest!</code> have the '!' symbol in them because they can crash: they crash when the list is empty. They have their non-crashing versions called <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code> that return a <code>Maybe</code>. We'll learn more about maybes in <a href="3-4-on-being-exceptional.html">another part</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let me (re)introduce you to <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>map</code> simply applies a function to all of the elements of the list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">map sqrt [1.0, 4.0, 9.0, 16.0]  # =&gt; [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
map (* 3) [5, 1, 3, 2]          # =&gt; [15, 3, 9, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>filter</code> takes a predicate and filters out all the elements that don't satisfy it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">filter (&lt; 5) [9, 3, 4, 7, 5, 10, 1]  # =&gt; [3, 4, 1]
filter even? [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]   # =&gt; [2, 4, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Then there is a nice <code>zip</code> function which &quot;zips&quot; two lists with some binary function (it's like <code>zipWith</code> from Haskell; the <code>zip</code> function from Haskell can be done with <code>zip pair</code> in Funky). It takes the first elements from both lists, applies the function to them, and goes on, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">zip (*) [1, 2, 3] [2, 3, 4]           # =&gt; [2, 6, 12]
zip (++) [&quot;he&quot;, &quot;wo&quot;] [&quot;llo&quot;, &quot;rld&quot;]  # =&gt; [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>zip</code> function enables this ultra cool hipster fibonacci one liner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func fibs : List Int =
    0 :: 1 :: zip (+) fibs (rest! fibs)
</code></pre>
<p>There are more list functions, like <code>fold&lt;</code> and <code>fold&gt;</code> (those are same as <code>foldr</code> and <code>foldl'</code> in Haskell), but we'll not give them too much attention, you can try them out on your own. For example, here's how you'd sum a list of numbers with <code>fold&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">fold&gt; (+) 0 (range 1 15)  # =&gt; 120
</code></pre>
<p>Other list functions include <code>reverse</code>, <code>take</code>, <code>drop</code>, <code>any</code>, <code>all</code>, <code>iterate</code>, and so on. The usual ones.</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-to-print-a-list-meet-the-for-loop" id="how-to-print-a-list-meet-the-for-loop"><h2>How to print a list? Meet the for loop</h2></a>
<p>Now, all that stuff is cool, but if we can't print a list, it's all useless, right? Well, this leads us to a very interesting function from the standard library called <code>for</code>. Yes, the name is intentionally chosen to match the name of the old imperative concept - the for loop. Of course, loops in imperative programming rely on mutation of the loop variables. We can't do that in functional programming, but our for loop will be just as ergonomic as the imperative one.</p>
<p>So, what's the type of this mighty <code>for</code> function?</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; for
List a -&gt; (a -&gt; c -&gt; c) -&gt; c -&gt; c
</code></pre>
<p>It takes three arguments. Here's what they are and how you can think about them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List</strong> (type <code>List a</code>). This is the list of things we want to loop over.</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong> (type <code>a -&gt; c -&gt; c</code>). You can think of this as something we want to &quot;do&quot; for each element.</li>
<li><strong>Next</strong> (type <code>c</code>). This will get &quot;done&quot; after getting over with all the elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the descriptions above are rather innacurate. We can't <em>do</em> anything, we can only make values and data structures.</p>
<p>The best way to explain what <code>for</code> does is to start with an example. So, <strong>let's print a list</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]
        println;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Oh man, that looks imperative! Does it even work?</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd for.fn
A
B
C
</code></pre>
<p>It does!</p>
<p>We've passed <code>[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]</code> as the list to <code>for</code>. Then we passed <code>println</code> as the body. The <code>println</code> function perfectly fits the required type of the argument: <code>a -&gt; c -&gt; c</code>, specialized to <code>String -&gt; IO -&gt; IO</code> in our case. Because <code>println</code> takes and returns <code>IO</code>, the last argument to <code>for</code> must be an <code>IO</code>. So we passed <code>quit</code>.</p>
<p>As we already know, <code>println</code> constructs the <code>IO</code> data structure and the same goes for <code>quit</code>. So <code>for</code> is in fact just applying functions in some way. What could that way be?</p>
<p>First of all, if we pass an empty list, we just get the <strong>next</strong> back.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">for [] body next  # =&gt; next
</code></pre>
<p>If we pass a single element list, we get the <strong>body</strong> applied to the element and the next:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">for [a] body next  # =&gt; body a next
</code></pre>
<p>What about a two element list? Well, that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">for [a, b] body next  # =&gt; body a (body b next)
</code></pre>
<p>Three elements?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">for [a, b, c] body next  # =&gt; body a (body b (body c next))
</code></pre>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">for (x :: xs) body next
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">body x (for xs body next)
</code></pre>
<p>which can be easily rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">body x;
for xs body;
next
</code></pre>
<p>The working of <code>for</code> can also be seen on the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="for-loop-diagram.png" alt="For loop diagram" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Yes, <code>for</code> is exactly the same function as <code>fold&lt;</code>, except with a different order of arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing this, it's easy to see that our list printing program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]
        println;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>basically expands to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    println &quot;A&quot;;
    println &quot;B&quot;;
    println &quot;C&quot;;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>It's all very clear now!</p>
<p>The <strong>next</strong> argument doesn't have to be just a <code>quit</code>. It can be more complex:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]
        println;
    println &quot;Done!&quot;;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>or even another <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]
        println;
    println &quot;First half!&quot;;
    for [&quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]
        println;
    println &quot;Second half!&quot;;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>With the semicolon, we can get much of the convenient code structuring of imperative programming. <strong>Without monads!</strong></p>

<p>If we change the list to a list of numbers, the scheme no longer works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for (range 1 5)
        println;
    quit
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> The <code>range</code> function takes the lower and the upper bound and evaluates to a list of all integers in between, including the bounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying to run this gives us an error:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd for.fn
for.fn:3:9: type-checking error
</code></pre>
<p>That's quite obvious. We have a list of <code>Int</code>s, but <code>println</code> takes a <code>String</code>. This can be fixed by composing <code>println</code> with <code>string</code>, which converts <code>Int</code>s (and is overloaded for other types) to <code>String</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for (range 1 5)
        (println . string);
    quit

<p>This time, it works!</p>

<a class="header" href="#how-to-put-more-things-in-a-body" id="how-to-put-more-things-in-a-body"><h3>How to put more things in a body?</h3></a>
<p>So far, we've only seen a simple function, or a composition of two functions as the body argument to <code>for</code>. What if we want to have a more elaborate loop body? Say a two <code>println</code>s for the start.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to try this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for (range 1 5)
        (print &quot;#&quot;; println);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>But that just doesn't work. We can't pass <code>println</code> as the second argument to <code>print</code>, that's just nonsense, it expects an <code>IO</code>, not <code>String -&gt; IO -&gt; IO</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what we need to do.</strong> Let's start with the simple for loop on strings.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]
        println;
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of just passing the function <code>println</code> itself, let's make it a lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;] (
        \s \next
        println s;
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>The body of the <code>for</code> loop takes two arguments: the <em>element</em> of type <code>String</code>, and the <em>continuation</em> of type <code>IO</code>. We pass both of these to the <code>println</code> function, recreating the original, short for loop. This doesn't at all change the behavior of the program.</p>
<p>However, as you can surely see, it's very straightforward to add more &quot;statements&quot; to the body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;] (
        \s \next
        print &quot;- &quot;;
        println s;
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Let's run it!</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd body.fn
- A
- B
- C
</code></pre>
<p>We can even add scans to the loop!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    print &quot;What's the number of questions? &quot;;
    scanln \n-str
    let (int n-str) \n
    for (range 1 n) (
        \i \next
        print (&quot;Your question #&quot; ++ string i ++ &quot;: &quot;);
        scanln \question
        println &quot;The answer: IDK.&quot;;
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Let's run this funny program:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd questions.fn
What's the number of questions? 3           
Your question #1: What's your name?
The answer: IDK.
Your question #2: How are you doing IDK?
The answer: IDK.
Your question #3: Do you know anything?
The answer: IDK.
</code></pre>
<p>And you can even nest loops! Here's a program that prints out the small multiplications table... in a non-tabular form, but that's okay.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for (range 1 10) (
        \x \next
        for (range 1 10) (
            \y \next
            print (string x);
            print &quot; x &quot;;
            print (string y);
            print &quot; = &quot;;
            println (string (x * y));
            next
        );
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Those multiple prints aren't necessary, it could've all been done with one long string concatenation. Splitting it into multiple lines just makes it clearer. This problem will go away once there is a better way to format strings.</p>

<p>And run it!</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd multiplications.fn

<p>It works! I didn't show the whole output, because that's too large, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>That's it for this part, in the next part, we'll learn more list tricks!</p>
<a class="header" href="#yield-it-all" id="yield-it-all"><h1>Yield it all!</h1></a>
<p>You thought vertical code was just for <code>IO</code>? You were wrong! Vertical code (the one that spans vertically and can be read top to bottom) is quite universal in Funky. In this part, we'll see how it can be applied to lists and their generation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-yield-function" id="the-yield-function"><h2>The <code>yield</code> function</h2></a>
<p>The basic list constructor, the double colon, is an infix function. That makes it unusable for vertical code. However, the standard library defines a synonym of <code>::</code> called <code>yield</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func yield : a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a = (::)
</code></pre>
<p>It's a literal synonym. But, it's a prefix function. How does that help?</p>
<p>Take this list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Rewrite it with the colons:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">1 :: 2 :: 3 :: empty
</code></pre>
<p>Cool. Now, how would this look if we used <code>yield</code> instead?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">yield 1 (yield 2 (yield 3 empty))
</code></pre>
<p>All we did was replace all <code>::</code>s with <code>yield</code>s. And here it comes. Can you see it? We can use the semicolon and make it vertical!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">yield 1;
yield 2;
yield 3;
empty
</code></pre>
<p>Beautiful!</p>
<p>To get to know <code>yield</code> a little better, let's use it to rewrite some well known functions. How would the <code>map</code> function look like using <code>yield</code>? Something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-map : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; List a -&gt; List b =
    \f \list
    for list (
        \x \next
        yield (f x);
        next
    );
    empty
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>for</code> function isn't just for <code>IO</code>. It can be used with anything that composes vertically. We take the function <code>f</code> and the <code>list</code> and we <code>yield</code> all of its elements in order, except we transform them with <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>We can even make the code shorter with function composition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-map : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; List a -&gt; List b =
    \f \list
    for list (yield . f);
    empty
</code></pre>
<p>That's really nice.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-when-function" id="the-when-function"><h2>The <code>when</code> function</h2></a>
<p>How would <code>filter</code> look like with <code>yield</code>? In the case of <code>filter</code>, we can't <code>yield</code> all the elements of the list. We must only <code>yield</code> those that satisfy the predicate. That's where the <code>when</code> function comes handy:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; when
Bool -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>It's kinda similar to <code>if</code>, but different. While <code>if</code> chooses between two alternatives, <code>when</code> conditionally applies its second argument (the <strong>body</strong>) to the third (the <strong>next</strong>). Specifically, <code>when</code> works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">when true body next   # =&gt; body next
when false body next  # =&gt; next
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">when (x &gt; 7) (1 +) x
</code></pre>
<p>This expression evaluates to <code>x + 1</code> if <code>x</code> is more than 7, otherwise it evaluates to <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>So, let's use <code>when</code> to implement <code>my-filter</code>!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-filter : (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; List a -&gt; List a =
    \p \list
    for list (
        \x \next
        when (p x) (yield x);
        next
    );
    empty
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Here, we can't easily compress the loop body into some stunning composition, but so what. It isn't that bad anyway.</p>
<a class="header" href="#formatting-lists" id="formatting-lists"><h2>Formatting lists</h2></a>
<p>Structuring list generation vertically comes very handy when dealing with complex list generating functions. One of the best examples is a function to format lists so that we can print them with one <code>println</code>. Such function isn't currently present in the standard library. But we'll make our own!</p>
<p>First, we gotta choose the type. What could it be? Perhaps this one?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">List a -&gt; String
</code></pre>
<p>Well, this is what it will be in the future, when the <a href="4-2-planned-considered-wanted-features.html#the-with-clause-planned"><code>with</code> clause</a> gets implemented, but so far, we can't do it that way. Why? We're accepting <code>List a</code>: a list of any type. To convert it to string, we need to convert each of its elements to string. But, there's no general way of converting an arbitrary type to string - the <code>string</code> function is only implemented for a handful of types.</p>
<p>This will do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(a -&gt; String) -&gt; List a -&gt; String
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to the list itself, we'll accept a function that helps us convert the elements to strings. Okay, let's get to the code!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func list-&gt;string : (a -&gt; String) -&gt; List a -&gt; String =
    \str \list
    # TODO
</code></pre>
<p>The type <code>String</code> is an alias for <code>List Char</code> - the list of characters. That's what we have to produce. We start with the opening square bracket:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func list-&gt;string : (a -&gt; String) -&gt; List a -&gt; String =
    \str \list
    yield '[';
    # TODO
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have to loop over the list and yield the string versions of the elements. We also gotta put commas between them. We gotta put a comma before each element except the first one. How are we going to achieve that?</p>
<p>We'll learn two more functions: <code>enumerate</code> and <code>for-pair</code>. The <code>enumerate</code> function takes a list and adds an index to each element. Its type is <code>List a -&gt; List (Pair Int a)</code>. For example: <code>enumerate [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, C&quot;]</code> evaluates to <code>[pair 0 &quot;A&quot;, pair 1 &quot;B&quot;, pair 2 &quot;C&quot;]</code>. You get the idea. Now, <code>for-pair</code> lets us easily iterate over a list of pairs. It's just like <code>for</code>, but it's body function takes two elements instead of one - <code>for-pair</code> unpacks the pairs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func list-&gt;string : (a -&gt; String) -&gt; List a -&gt; String =
    \str \list
    yield '[';
    for-pair (enumerate list) (
        \i \x \next
        # TODO
    );
    # TODO
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>i</code> variable is the index, the <code>x</code> variable is the original element from <code>list</code>. If the index is zero, we know we're dealing with the first element and we won't add the comma. Otherwise, we'll add it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func list-&gt;string : (a -&gt; String) -&gt; List a -&gt; String =
    \str \list
    yield '[';
    for-pair (enumerate list) (
        \i \x \next
        when (i &gt; 0) (yield-all &quot;, &quot;);
        yield-all (str x);
        next
    );
    # TODO
</code></pre>
<p>What's that <code>yield-all</code>? It's just like <code>yield</code>, but it yields a whole list of things, instead of just one element. It's a synonym for <code>++</code>. In general:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">yield-all list;
next
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">for list yield;
next
</code></pre>
<p>All that remains now is finishing with the closing square bracket:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func list-&gt;string : (a -&gt; String) -&gt; List a -&gt; String =
    \str \list
    yield '[';
    for-pair (enumerate list) (
        \i \x \next
        when (i &gt; 0) (yield-all &quot;, &quot;);
        yield-all (str x);
        next
    );
    yield ']';
    empty
</code></pre>
<p>And we're done! It's so nice and readable having this function expressed vertically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Actually, <code>list-&gt;string</code> can be done nicer in a functional style using the <code>join</code> function.</p>
<p><code>&quot;[&quot; ++ join &quot;, &quot; (map str list) ++ &quot;]&quot;</code></p>
<p>Functional solutions are often superior to imperative ones. We've done <code>list-&gt;string</code> imperatively just for the demonstration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's test it out! We'll print all the primes until 100. First, the prime testing function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func prime? : Int -&gt; Bool =
    \n
    all (\x not zero?; n % x) (range 2 (n - 1))
</code></pre>
<p>It simply tests whether no number between 2 and n-1 divides n. The <code>%</code> sign is the modulo operator. Now we'll make an infinite list of primes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func primes : List Int =
    filter prime? (iterate (+ 1) 2)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> The function <code>iterate</code> successively applies the provided function to the provided initial value producing an infinite list of all the results. In our case, <code>iterate (+ 1) 2</code> produces <code>[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]</code>. For example, <code>iterate (* 2) 1</code> would produce <code>[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, now, let's print them up to 100:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (take-while (&lt; 100) primes) \primes&lt;100
    println (list-&gt;string string primes&lt;100);
    quit
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> The <code>take-while</code> function is different from <code>filter</code>. While <code>filter</code> takes <em>all</em> the elements that satisfy a predicate, <code>take-while</code> takes elements from the list, but <em>stops</em> taking them the moment it encounters the first element to not satisfy the predicate. That's important here. Had we used <code>filter</code>, the program wouldn't halt. It would continue searching the infinite list of primes for another element less than 100, but it would never find one. Using <code>take-while</code> makes the program halt, because we never search beyond the first wrong one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's run it!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">$ funkycmd primes.fn
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
</code></pre>
<p>Works like charm!</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll learn how to express state flow. Things will get really imperative... in a purely functional way.</p>
<a class="header" href="#isnt--imperative" id="isnt--imperative"><h1>Isn't := imperative?</h1></a>
<p>Sometimes, the best way to express a function is by a series of state-changing steps. In other words, by an <em>imperative algorithm</em>. For example, say we want to reverse a list. That's a fairly common thing. Sure, we could use the <code>reverse</code> function from the standard library, but how can we make one ourselves?</p>
<p>Here's a way to make it happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have two variables: <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>.</li>
<li>Store the input list in the <code>left</code> variable.</li>
<li>Store an empty list in the <code>right</code> variable.</li>
<li>Repeat until the <code>left</code> list is empty:
<ol>
<li>Add the first element of the <code>left</code> list to the beginning of the <code>right</code> list.</li>
<li>Remove the first element from the <code>left</code> list.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Output the <code>right</code> list.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, let's try and reverse <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>. Here's how the algorithm would proceed:</p>
<pre><code>           left | right
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] | []
   [2, 3, 4, 5] | [1]
      [3, 4, 5] | [2, 1]
         [4, 5] | [3, 2, 1]
            [5] | [4, 3, 2, 1]
             [] | [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>At the end, the <code>left</code> list is empty and the <code>right</code> list contains the reversed version of the original input list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Adding/removing an element to/from the beginning of a list is efficient (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Constant_time">constant time</a>). The whole algorithm therefore runs in time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linear_time">linearly proportional</a> to the size of the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could we implement such an algorithm in Funky?</p>
<p>Well, this one isn't particularly hard. We can utilize recursion to simulate the state flow. We create a function called <code>my-reverse-algo</code>, which has two arguments: <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. Those represent the two variables used in the algorithm. If the <code>left</code> list is empty, <code>my-reverse-algo</code> simply returns the <code>right</code> list. Otherwise, it returns from a recursive call with the variables updated appropriately.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-reverse-algo : List a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a =
    \left \right
    if (empty? left) right;
    my-reverse-algo (rest! left) (first! left :: right)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> In most languages, each recursive call would grow the stack and we would quickly run out of memory. This doesn't happen in Funky thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion</a>. If a function should evaluate directly to another function call, it simply jumps to that function, effectively creating an efficient loop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we'll use <code>my-reverse-algo</code> to implement <code>my-reverse</code>. It'll just pass the correct initial values to <code>my-reverse-algo</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-reverse : List a -&gt; List a =
    \list
    my-reverse-algo list []
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see if it works!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for (my-reverse [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        (println . string);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>And run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd my-reverse.fn
5
4
3
2
1
</code></pre>
<p>Nice!</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-recur-function" id="the-recur-function"><h2>The <code>recur</code> function</h2></a>
<p>Could we somohow get rid of the helper <code>my-reverse-algo</code> function? It isn't really useful on its own, it's just an implementation detail. It shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>What would help would be some way to define recursive functions anonymously, i.e. without making a global <code>func</code> definition. That way we could define <code>my-reverse-algo</code> directly inside <code>my-reverse</code>.</p>
<p>The function for this job is called <code>recur</code>, otherwise known as the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">fixpoint combinator</a></em>, or the <em>Y combinator</em>. It's a pretty mind-blowing function. I won't explain how it works (it took me a long time to figure it out), but I'll explain how you can use it.</p>
<p>Here's the type, but it won't help you figure out much:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd -types
&gt; recur
(a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so how to use it? Let's take this really simple recursive function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func ones : List Int = 1 :: ones  # [1, 1, 1, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>It isn't even a function, it's just a recursive list.</p>
<p>We can express the same recursive list using <code>recur</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">recur \ones 1 :: ones
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>ones</code> isn't a global definition in this case, it's just a local bindning. Does it work?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    for (take 5; recur \ones 1 :: ones)
        (println . string);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>We only take the first five elements, because the list is infinite.</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd ones.fn
1
1
1
1
1
</code></pre>
<p>It does work!</p>
<p>What about this function?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func count-from : Int -&gt; List Int =
    \x x :: count-from (x + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>For example, <code>count-from 4</code> evaluates to <code>[4, 5, 6, 7, ...]</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>recur</code>, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">recur \count-from \x
x :: count-from (x + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>You can try it yourself. Remember, that this time it's a function with one argument, so you need to pass it in.</p>
<p>So, I guess you got it, right? <strong>To define an anonymous recursive function</strong>, simply type <code>recur</code> and pass it a lambda where the first argument acts as the name of the recursive function and the rest are its arguments. Simple as that.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the--function" id="the--function"><h3>The <code>|&gt;</code> function</h3></a>
<p>What about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">recur \fibs \a \b
a :: fibs b (a + b)
</code></pre>
<p>This defines a function that given two initial numbers produces a Fibonacci-like sequence. If we give it 0 and 1 as the initial numbers, it will produce the Fibonacci sequence precisely:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(recur \fibs \a \b
a :: fibs b (a + b)) 0 1
</code></pre>
<p>Have you noticed them? The 0 and 1 that we passed in. They are right there, at the end of the expression. Perhaps you saw them, perhaps you didn't, but you surely must admit that it doesn't look very fashionable.</p>
<p>Instead of simply passing the arguments as usual, we can use the <code>|&gt;</code> function to pass them. It works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">x |&gt; f
</code></pre>
<p>is the same as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">f x
</code></pre>
<p>So, with <code>|&gt;</code>, we can rewrite the previos expression like this, but we need to pass the arguments in a seemingly reverse order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">1 |&gt; 0 |&gt; recur \fibs \a \b
a :: fibs b (a + b)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explanation.</strong> The above code works, we pass <code>0</code> for <code>a</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>b</code>, not the other way around. This is because <code>y |&gt; x |&gt; f</code> is the same as <code>y |&gt; (x |&gt; f)</code>, which reduces to <code>y |&gt; f x</code>, and finally <code>f x y</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole expression evaluates to just <code>[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...]</code>, the infinite Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<p>I admit, the whole thing about passing the arguments in a seemingly reverse order may look kinda confusing to you, but don't worry, you'll get used it. It's very versatile, and the whole thing didn't require a single language addition.</p>
<a class="header" href="#back-to-reversing-lists" id="back-to-reversing-lists"><h3>Back to reversing lists</h3></a>
<p>Can we use <code>recur</code> to get rid of the extra <code>my-reverse-algo</code> function?</p>
<p>For the reminder, here's how it looks with the extra function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-reverse-algo : List a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a =
    \left \right
    if (empty? left) right;
    my-reverse-algo (rest! left) (first! left :: right)

func my-reverse : List a -&gt; List a =
    \list
    my-reverse-algo list []
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the solution. All we have to do is replace <code>my-reverse-algo</code> in the body of <code>my-reverse</code> with an anonymous definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-reverse : List a -&gt; List a =
    \list
    (recur \my-reverse-algo \left \right
    if (empty? left) right;
    my-reverse-algo (rest! left) (first! left :: right)) list []
</code></pre>
<p>And we'll use <code>|&gt;</code> to make it more readable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-reverse : List a -&gt; List a =
    \list
    [] |&gt; list |&gt; recur \my-reverse-algo \left \right
    if (empty? left) right;
    my-reverse-algo (rest! left) (first! left :: right)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The last change we'll make</strong> is we'll rename <code>my-reverse-algo</code> to simply <code>loop</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func my-reverse : List a -&gt; List a =
    \list
    [] |&gt; list |&gt; recur \loop \left \right
    if (empty? left) right;
    loop (rest! left) (first! left :: right)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This is a little convention.</strong> In cases like this, we choose <code>loop</code> as the local name of the recursive function. It makes it immediately clear that we're using <code>recur</code> to simulate a simple stateful loop.</p>
<a class="header" href="#procedures" id="procedures"><h2>Procedures</h2></a>
<p>Sometimes, simple loops like the above aren't powerful enough. Of course, we prefer them whenever possible. But some algorithms require a more nuanced expression.</p>
<p>A good example is the <strong>imperative version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort algorithm</a></strong>, i.e. quicksort on random-access arrays. That's a little too tough for the start, but we'll come back to it by the end of this part.</p>
<p>First, we need to learn how to express imperative algorithms. The standard library offers a type specifically for this purpose: <code>Proc</code>. That's short for <em>procedure</em>. It's a simple union with this definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Proc s r =
    view (s -&gt; Proc s r)       |
    update (s -&gt; s) (Proc s r) |
    return r                   |
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> <code>Proc</code> is an equivalent of the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/State_Monad"><code>State</code> monad</a> from Haskell and was initially called the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, what's <code>Proc</code> all about? You can think of it as a description of a procedure that runs in some stateful context, (usually) changes it, and results in some return value. Let's take a close look!</p>
<p>First, it has <strong>two type variables</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>s</code></strong>. This is the type of the state context the procedure will run in. For example, if <code>s</code> is <code>Int</code>, then the procedure will begin its execution with some initial <code>Int</code>, say <code>4</code>, be able to change it and check its current value during its execution.</li>
<li><strong><code>r</code></strong>. This it the return type. When a procedure finishes, it returns some value, just like procedures in imperative languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, it's a union with <strong>three alternatives or commands</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>view</code></strong>. Used to check the current value of the state. Notice that its signature resembles the signature of <code>scanln</code> and similar functions. It's used the same way.</li>
<li><strong><code>update</code></strong>. This one is used to change the state. It takes a function of type <code>s -&gt; s</code>. When executing the procedure, the current state will be mapped through this function. The second argument is a contination - tells what should be done next. The <code>update</code> function is used in the same way as <code>println</code> and similar functions.</li>
<li><strong><code>return</code></strong>. Marks the end of the procedure and specifies the return value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these three instructions together with our already acquired battle-tested tools, like <code>if</code> and <code>for</code>, we can make descriptions of stateful procedures.</p>
<p>Let's see that in action!</p>
<p>Our first trivial example will be a procedure who's state context is just an <code>Int</code> and which returns an <code>Int</code> as well. When executed, it will increment the number in the state by 1 and return its new value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func increment : Proc Int Int =
    update (+ 1);
    view \x
    return x
</code></pre>
<p>First, we update the state using <code>(+ 1)</code> (which is the same as <code>(\x x + 1)</code>). Then we get the current (updated) state and return it.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>return</code> function has an overloaded version</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func return : (s -&gt; r) -&gt; Proc s r =
    \f
    view \x
    return (f x)
</code></pre>
<p>It takes the current state and makes a return value from it using the supplied function. In our case, we just want to return the state directly, so we'll use <code>self</code> (which is the identity function: <code>\x x</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func increment : Proc Int Int =
    update (+ 1);
    return self
</code></pre>
<p>That's quite neat! Now, keep in mind, all we have constructed is a data structure - a description. How do we execute it?</p>
<p><strong>We need to provide some initial state value.</strong> The function <code>start-with</code> is for just that. Here's how it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func start-with : s -&gt; Proc s r -&gt; r
</code></pre>
<p>It takes the initial state, then a procedure, and apparently it executes the procedure and evaluates to its return value. Let's see how that works!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (start-with 6 increment) \x
    println (string x);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>And run this:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd increment.fn
7
</code></pre>
<p>What if we want to execute <code>increment</code> multiple times? We can do that using the <code>call</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func call : Proc s a -&gt; Proc s b -&gt; Proc s b
</code></pre>
<p>This function is used for <strong>executing one procedure inside another procedure</strong>, discarding the return value of the first (we are able to get it, just wait a moment).</p>
<p>It takes two procedures and produces a new procedure that executes them one after another, returning the result of the second one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (start-with 6 (call increment increment)) \x
    println (string x);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd call.fn
8
</code></pre>
<p>Yep, it works! We can even reorganize it horizontally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (
        start-with 6;
        call increment;
        increment
    ) \x
    println (string x);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>We could even increment four times!</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (
        start-with 6;
        call increment;
        call increment;
        call increment;
        increment
    ) \x
    println (string x);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>call</code> function has another version with this type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func call : Proc s a -&gt; (a -&gt; Proc s b) -&gt; Proc s b
</code></pre>
<p>It's the same as the first version, except that instead of taking just a procedure as the second argument, it accepts a function taking the return value of the first procedure. The usage is quite straightforward.</p>
<p>Just for fun, let's gather all the return values from those three <code>increment</code>s using this new <code>call</code> version and return their sum:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (
        start-with 6;
        call increment \x
        call increment \y
        call increment \z
        return (x + y + z)
    ) \w
    println (string w);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>What will be the result?</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd call.fn
24
</code></pre>
<p>That's because 7+8+9=24.</p>
<a class="header" href="#records-as-state-contexts-----and-" id="records-as-state-contexts-----and-"><h3>Records as state contexts (<code>&lt;-</code>, <code>-&gt;</code>, and <code>:=</code>)</h3></a>
<p>Imperative algorithms usually work with <strong>multiple variables</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, a simple algorithm to accumulate an average of a stream of numbers must store two variables: the sum and the count. The final average is then obtained by dividing one by the other. To add a number to the average, we add it to the sum and we increase the count by 1.</p>
<p>A natural way to store these two variables in Funky is with a record:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Average =
    sum   : Int,
    count : Int,
</code></pre>
<p>Then, using the record accessors, we can make a procedure to add a number to the average:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func add : Int -&gt; Proc Average Nothing =
    \number
    update (sum (+ number));
    update (count (+ 1));
    return nothing
</code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>Nothing</code> return type, which is a type with only a single possible value: <code>nothing</code>. We use it to denote a procedure with no (useful) return value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> <code>Nothing</code> is the same type as <code>()</code> in Haskell or <code>Unit</code> in some other languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't so bad. But, trust me, writing <code>update (field ...)</code> over and over gets tiresome with longer procedures. Records are so frequent here that the standard library provides some special treatment for them.</p>
<p><strong>The first function for this purpose is <code>&lt;-</code>.</strong> It's used to change a record field (or a nested field) in a procedure. Whenever you write this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">update (field function)
</code></pre>
<p>you can instead rewrite it to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">field &lt;- function
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The <code>&lt;-</code> function has type <code>((a -&gt; a) -&gt; s -&gt; s) -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; Proc s r -&gt; Proc s r</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we can rewrite our <code>add</code> function into this beautiful piece of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func add : Int -&gt; Proc Average Nothing =
    \number
    sum &lt;- + number;
    count &lt;- + 1;
    return nothing
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Another useful function is <code>-&gt;</code>.</strong> On the left side, it takes a getter, a function from the state type. Then it passes its result to the lambda on the right. It's like an enhanced <code>view</code> - whereas <code>view</code> always gives back the entire state, <code>-&gt;</code> gives you the part of the state you request.</p>
<p>For example, how about a procedure that returns the actual current average as an <code>Int</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func average : Proc Average Int =
    sum -&gt; \s
    count -&gt; \c
    return (if (zero? c) 0 (s / c))
</code></pre>
<p>Simple as that. We make sure to handle the case when the <code>count</code> is 0 using <code>if</code> as a ternary operator.</p>
<p>Using <code>add</code> and <code>average</code>, we can compose an imperative algorithm for calculating the average of a list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func average : List Int -&gt; Int =
    \numbers
    start-with (Average 0 0);
    for numbers (call . add);
    call average \avg  # call to the procedure, not a recursive call
    return avg
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> We overloaded the name <code>average</code> for two purposes here: one is the procedure and the other is the function. No worries, Funky can always tell the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that this <code>average</code> function has no <code>Proc</code> in the type. All the procedure stuff is encapsulated inside of it. To the outside world, it appears simply as another function.</p>
<p><strong>The last function for working with records in procedures is <code>:=</code>.</strong> It's similar to <code>&lt;-</code>, but instead of transforming the original value using a function, it simply overwrites it with a new value.</p>
<p>In other words, you can always replace this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">field &lt;- const value
</code></pre>
<p>with this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">field := value
</code></pre>
<p>Say we wanted to reset the average counter. Here's what it would look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func reset : Proc Average Nothing =
    sum := 0;
    count := 0;
    return nothing
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> There's an overloaded version of <code>:=</code> which takes a function from the state instead of a direct value. It can be used to copy one part of the state into another. We could for example write: <code>sum := count</code>, even though that wouldn't make any sense. But, be careful. You <strong>can't</strong> write <code>sum := count * 2</code>, because <code>count</code> is a getter (a function) here, not a number. You could write <code>sum := (\s count s * 2)</code>, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, <strong>the function <code>self</code></strong> acts as both a getter and an updater for the whole state. Remember this function?</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func increment : Proc Int Int =
    update (+ 1);
    return self
</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func increment : Proc Int Int =
    self &lt;- + 1;
    return self
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, this usage was one of the motivations for naming it <code>self</code> instead of <code>id</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#arrays" id="arrays"><h3>Arrays</h3></a>
<p>The last piece of puzzle before we can finally implement the quicksort algorithm is random-access arrays.</p>
<p>Arrays in Funky are a bit different than arrays in imperative language, because we aren't allowed to mutate anything. To change an element in an array we must make a new array. But no full copies need to be performed. The new array can always share as much data as possible with the old one and thus the whole operation will be quite cheap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> Without cheating, there's really no such thing as in-place, mutable, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Constant_time">O(1)</a> access arrays in pure functional programming. All data structures have to be primarily tree-based and persistent.</p>
<p>However, there are efficient ways of implementing persistant arrays with O(log n) access time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the <code>Array</code> type in Funky implements an infinite array indexed by <code>Int</code>s (both positive and negative). <strong>To create an empty array, we use the <code>empty</code> function</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func empty : a -&gt; Array a
</code></pre>
<p>It takes one argument, which is the default initial value for all elements. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">empty 0
</code></pre>
<p>is an <code>Array Int</code> full of zeros. <strong>We use <code>at</code> to both get and update any element</strong> in the array. Here are the two overloaded versions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func at : Int -&gt; Array a -&gt; a
func at : Int -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; Array a -&gt; Array a
</code></pre>
<p>As you have surely noticed, they look very similar to getters and updaters in records, except that they take an additional <code>Int</code> argument - the index. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">at 5 array
</code></pre>
<p><strong>gets the element at the index 5</strong>, while:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">at 5 (+ 3) array
</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to a <strong>new array, where that element is increased by 3</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two more functions, namely <code>reset</code> and <code>swap</code>. We won't cover the first one, but we'll come back to the second one when we get to the quicksort.</p>
<p>That's basically all there is to arrays. <strong>The interesting part comes when integrating them with procedures.</strong></p>
<p>As we've already noticed, both version of <code>at</code> fit very well with the form of record accessors. And we can, in fact, use them the same way in procedures. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func some-array : Array Int =
    start-with (empty 0);
    at 0 := 7;
    at 1 := 4;
    at 2 := 9;
    at 3 := 5;
    at 4 := 2;
    return self

func main : IO =
    for (range 0 4) (
        \i \next
        println (string; at i some-array);
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>We manually assign values to the elements of an array. Then, in <code>main</code>, we loop over the indices from 0 to 4 and print the corresponding elements from the array. Does it work?</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd array.fn
7
4
9
5
2
</code></pre>
<p>Sure enough it does!</p>
<p>We can even shorten <code>some-array</code> with a for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func some-array : Array Int =
    start-with (empty 0);
    for-pair (enumerate [7, 4, 9, 5, 2])
        (\i \x at i := x);
    return self
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we know arrays, let's get on to the quicksort!</p>
<a class="header" href="#quicksort" id="quicksort"><h3>Quicksort</h3></a>
<p>If you've ever implemented quicksort, you must know that it's quite tricky to get it right unless you're a super brilliant genius. At least the first time.</p>
<p>Because of that, we'll make our job easier and <strong>simply translate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm">this algorithm from Wikipedia</a></strong>:</p>
<pre><code>algorithm quicksort(A, lo, hi) is
    if lo &lt; hi then
        p := partition(A, lo, hi)
        quicksort(A, lo, p - 1)
        quicksort(A, p + 1, hi)

algorithm partition(A, lo, hi) is
    pivot := A[hi]
    i := lo
    for j := lo to hi - 1 do
        if A[j] &lt; pivot then
            swap A[i] with A[j]
            i := i + 1
    swap A[i] with A[hi]
    return i
</code></pre>
<p>That's a pseudocode. We'll try and translate it to Funky. We'll make two procedures: <code>quicksort</code> and <code>partition</code>.</p>
<p>Since these are imperative, we'll need the array in their mutable state. The <code>partition</code> procedure also uses an index <code>i</code>, so we'll also need that in the state. This will be our state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Vars =
    array : Array Int,
    i     : Int,
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The <code>partition</code> procedure also uses an index <code>j</code>, but we need not include it in the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, now let's try and translate <code>partition</code>. I won't do it step-by-step, this is more of a show-off than a tutorial, but I'm sure you'll be able to follow it. Here it is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func partition : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Proc Vars Int =
    \lo \hi
    (at hi . array) -&gt; \pivot
    i := lo;
    for (range lo (hi - 1)) (
        \j \next
        (at j . array) -&gt; \at-j
        when (at-j &lt; pivot) (
            \next
            i -&gt; \ii
            array &lt;- swap ii j;
            i &lt;- + 1;
            next
        );
        next
    );
    i -&gt; \ii
    array &lt;- swap ii hi;
    return ii
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Details.</strong> The <code>swap</code> function has type <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Array a -&gt; Array a</code> and does the obvious: evaluates to an array with the corresponding elements swapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's definitely a little longer than the pseudocode. Most of the extra lines are from the lambdas and getting the current value of <code>i</code>. But otherwise, it reads very similar.</p>
<p>Now onto the <code>quicksort</code> procedure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func quicksort : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Proc Vars Nothing =
    \lo \hi
    if (lo &gt;= hi)
        (return nothing);
    call (partition lo hi) \p
    call (quicksort lo (p - 1));
    call (quicksort (p + 1) hi);
    return nothing
</code></pre>
<p>This one is very straightforward. The only thing we changed from the pseudocode is that we inverted the condition. The pseudocode <em>does</em> something when <code>lo &lt; hi</code>, we instead <em>halt</em> the procedure in the other case.</p>
<p>Let's see if this all works.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (
        start-with (Vars (empty 0) 0);
        for-pair (enumerate [2, 6, 1, 0, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 8])
            (\i \x (array . at i) := x);
        call (quicksort 0 9);
        return array
    ) \arr
    for (range 0 9) (
        \i \next
        println (string; at i arr);
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>In this <code>main</code> function, we first start with an empty array and a zero <code>i</code> variable (which is irrelevant). Then we assign some random numbers to the first 10 indices of the array. Then we quicksort them and bind the resulting array to <code>arr</code> using <code>let</code>. Then we print the first 10 elements and see if it worked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">$ funkycmd quicksort.fn
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</code></pre>
<p>It worked perfectly!</p>
<p>So, as you can see, we can write imperative algorithms quite straightforwardly in Funky!</p>
<a class="header" href="#mixing-procedures-with-io" id="mixing-procedures-with-io"><h2>Mixing procedures with IO</h2></a>
<p>Forget <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Monad_transformers">monad transformers</a> (if you've used Haskell), mixing procedures with IO isn't such a big deal. I'll show you how to do it.</p>
<p>So, we have this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let (
        start-with (Vars (empty 0) 0);
        for-pair (enumerate [2, 6, 1, 0, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 8])
            (\i \x (array . at i) := x);
        call (quicksort 0 9);
        return array
    ) \arr
    for (range 0 9) (
        \i \next
        println (string; at i arr);
        next
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>But the <code>let</code> is in fact not needed. Remember, there's an overloaded version of <code>return</code> (which we are in fact using in this code) with this type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func return : (s -&gt; a) -&gt; Proc s a
</code></pre>
<p>How about we used it rather differently than we already have? What if we passed it a function of type <code>Vars -&gt; IO</code>? Something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    start-with (Vars (empty 0) 0);
    for-pair (enumerate [2, 6, 1, 0, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 8])
        (\i \x (array . at i) := x);
    call (quicksort 0 9);
    return \vars                              # &lt;
    for (range 0 9) (                         # &lt;
        \i \next                              # &lt;
        println (string; at i (array vars));  # &lt;
        next                                  # &lt;
    );                                        # &lt;
    quit                                      # &lt;
</code></pre>
<p>I marked the function which we passed to <code>return</code>. It took <code>vars</code>, which is the whole state of the above procedure and made some <code>IO</code> out of it. The whole procedure now has type <code>Proc Vars IO</code> and so <code>start-with</code> turns it into just <code>IO</code>. Everything works:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd quicksort.fn
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</code></pre>
<p><strong>That's how we switch from <code>Proc</code> to <code>IO</code>!</strong> How do we switch back? Just <code>start-with</code> again! You have the last state, reuse it. We need to make sure, though, that we return some <code>IO</code> at the end.</p>
<p>Here's a simple program that reads 10 numbers from the input and prints out the average after each one (uses the <code>Average</code> record we defined earlier):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    start-with (Average 0 0);

    for (range 1 10) (
        \i \next
        call average \avg
        return \a
        println (&quot;Current average is &quot; ++ string avg ++ &quot;.&quot;);
        print (&quot;Number #&quot; ++ string i ++ &quot;: &quot;);
        scanln; int |&gt; \x
        start-with a;
        call (add x);
        next
    );

    call average \avg
    return \a
    println (&quot;Final average is &quot; ++ string avg ++ &quot;.&quot;);
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure we could shave off some lines in a true imperative language, but so what! It's not bad for a purely functional one.</p>
<p>That's all for this part. In the next part, we'll shine some light on <em>&quot;exception&quot; handling</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#on-being-exceptional" id="on-being-exceptional"><h1>On being exceptional</h1></a>
<p>What a better way to finish a tour than by talking about failing, right? Different languages solve the problem of failure differently. Many use the concept of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exceptions</a></em>: when an exception occurs, the program breaks its control flow and starts back-tracking the calls until it finds an appropriate exception handler. Other languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go</a> do it differently, they employ error values that the programmer must manually check.</p>
<p>In this part, we'll talk about how error handling can be done in Funky. Of course, just like pretty much anything else, error handling isn't built-in to the language but is a part of the standard library instead.</p>
<p><strong>The standard library currently only implements the simplest form of error handling: the <code>Maybe</code> type.</strong> More sophisticated error types will be added when the need and specific use-cases arise.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-maybe-type" id="the-maybe-type"><h2>The <code>Maybe</code> type</h2></a>
<p>Most functions always succeed. But some can also fail. To represent failure, we need a new type. The simplest (and so far only) type for this purpose is <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Maybe a = none | some a
</code></pre>
<p>It has two alternatives: <strong>none</strong> and <strong>some</strong>. The former is a failure. The latter is a success.</p>
<p>Do you remember the list manipulation functions <code>first!</code> and <code>rest!</code>? Well, they crash when the list is empty. Crashing the whole program isn't usually desirable and so there are non-crashing alternatives: <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code>. What do they return? A <code>Maybe</code> of course:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func first : List a -&gt; Maybe a
func rest  : List a -&gt; Maybe (List a)
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let [1, 2, 3, 4] \nums
    println (
        switch first nums
        case none
            &quot;nothing there&quot;
        case some \x
            &quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>It works:</p>
<pre><code>$ funkycmd maybe.fn
the first is 1
</code></pre>
<p>If we don't wanna use the <code>switch</code>, we can use <code>none?</code> and <code>extract!</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let [1, 2, 3, 4] \nums
    println (
        let (first nums) \maybe-x
        if (none? maybe-x) &quot;nothing there&quot;;
        &quot;the first is &quot; ++ string (extract! maybe-x)
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> The function <code>extract!</code> can crash, so use at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet another alternative would be to use <code>?</code> and <code>map</code>. They're quite simple, but I'll explain them. Here are their types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func ?   : a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
func map : (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>?</code> function takes a <em>default value</em> and a maybe and evaluates to the default value if the maybe is <code>none</code>. Otherwise it evaluates to the value inside the maybe. For example: <code>0 ? none</code> evaluates to <code>0</code>, while <code>0 ? some 3</code> evaluates to <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> function transforms the value inside a maybe using the supplied function. If the maybe is <code>none</code>, the result will be <code>none</code> as well. For example: <code>map (+ 1) none</code> results in <code>none</code>, while <code>map (+ 1) (some 3)</code> results in <code>some 4</code>. It works very much like <code>map</code> for lists.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>map</code> function to turn the <code>Maybe Int</code> obtained from <code>first nums</code> into a <code>Maybe String</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">map (\x &quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x) (first nums)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use <code>?</code> to fill the case when the list is empty:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">&quot;nothing there&quot; ? map (\x &quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x) (first nums)
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the final program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let [1, 2, 3, 4] \nums
    println (&quot;nothing there&quot; ? map (\x &quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x) (first nums));
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>That line is quite long. Too long!</p>
<p>But, there's a solution! The functions <code>?</code> and <code>map</code> have synonyms that are suitable for vertical code. Namely: <code>if-none</code> and <code>let-some</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func if-none  : a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
func let-some : Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe b
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>if-none</code> is a precise synonym of <code>?</code>. And the only difference between <code>let-some</code> and <code>map</code> is the order of arguments.</p>
<p>We use <code>let-some</code> to safely extract a value from a maybe:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">let-some (first nums) \x
&quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x
</code></pre>
<p>The whole thing becomes a new maybe. To turn it into a naked value, we handle the <code>none</code> case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">if-none &quot;nothing there&quot;;
let-some (first nums) \x
&quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the whole thing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func main : IO =
    let [1, 2, 3, 4] \nums
    println (
        if-none &quot;nothing there&quot;;
        let-some (first nums) \x
        &quot;the first is &quot; ++ string x
    );
    quit
</code></pre>
<p>That's more readable!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Of couse, there are many cases when <code>?</code> and <code>map</code> are the right choices. Perhaps this one is too. Depends on your personal preference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this short refactoring exercise, we've seen most of the useful <code>Maybe</code> functions: <code>none?</code>, <code>extract!</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>if-none</code>, <code>let-some</code>.</p>
<p>There are some more, like <code>let-::</code>, <code>some?</code>, <code>for-some</code>, <code>filter-some</code>, and <code>when-some</code>. You can try them out on your own.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of giving another example, here's a simple function to get the third element of a list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func third : List a -&gt; Maybe a =
    \list
    let-some (rest list) \tail
    let-some (rest tail) \tail
    first tail
</code></pre>
<p>Or, here's a more complicated example that uses <code>let-::</code> (used for destructuring lists into the first element and the rest, otherwise very similar to <code>let-some</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func merge : List Int -&gt; List Int -&gt; List Int =
    \left \right
    if-none (left ++ right);
    let-:: left  \l \ls
    let-:: right \r \rs
    if (l &lt; r) (l :: merge ls right);
    r :: merge left rs

func merge-sort : List Int -&gt; List Int =
    \list
    let (length list) \len
    if (len &lt;= 1) list;
    let (take (len / 2) list) \left
    let (drop (len / 2) list) \right
    merge (merge-sort left) (merge-sort right)
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#the-power-of-functional-programming" id="the-power-of-functional-programming"><h1>The power of functional programming</h1></a>
<p>Over the course of the last few parts, we've learned how to do for loops, Python-like generators, and imperative algorithms. What has that got to do with functional programming?</p>
<p>Someone once said: <em>Functional programming makes difficult tasks easy and easy tasks difficult.</em></p>
<p>What they meant was that while it's often easy to express a complex algorithm in a few (or even one) lines of code, common things, like making a simple interacting command line program can be challenging and not elegant at all.</p>
<p>I believe this is because some problems are just easier to express imperatively. I thus hope that by making imperative idioms easily expressible in Funky, we can have a language where difficult tasks are easy and easy tasks are easy alike. Really difficult tasks will remain difficult, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>So, how does Funky support the <em>proper</em> functional programming idioms? In this part, we'll focus on those, particularly lists: the powerhouse of functional programming, and take a look at some really cool programs.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pascals-triangle" id="pascals-triangle"><h2>Pascal's triangle</h2></a>
<p>Our first problem will be to construct the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle">Pascal's triangle</a> as it is called, although it was definitely not first discovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>              1
            1   1
          1   2   1
        1   3   3   1
      1   4   6   4   1
    1   5   10  10  5   1
  1   6   15  20  15  6   1
1   7   21  35  35  21  7   1
</code></pre>
<p>It's all ones on the edges, but other than that, each number is exactly the sum of the two numbers above it. Those are just the first eight rows, of course, there's infinite number of them. If you're not familiar with the properties of this triangle, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle">Wikipedia page</a>, they're quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Alright, so let's make Pascal's triangle. Since Funky is lazy, we can express it as an infinite list of rows. Each row of course is a list of integers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func pascal's-triangle : List (List Int) =
    # ???
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the first row is <code>[1]</code>. It would be nice if we make some function that can transform one row into the next one. Then we could use <code>iterate</code>, which works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">iterate f x = [x, f x, f (f x), f (f (f x)), ...]
</code></pre>
<p>to generate the whole list of rows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func pascal's-triangle : List (List Int) =
    iterate ??? [1]
</code></pre>
<p>What could be the function to transition from one row to the other? The function <code>adjacent</code> comes handy here. It works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">adjacent f [x, y, z, w, ...] = [f x y, f y z, f z w, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>It pairs each pair of adjacent elements in the list with the supplied function. That's almost exactly what we want. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">adjacent (+) [1, 3, 3, 1] =&gt; [4, 6, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>All that's missing are the ones at the edges. That's easy to fix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">[1] ++ adjacent (+) [1, 3, 3, 1] ++ [1] =&gt; [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>And here's the final function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func pascal's-triangle : List (List Int) =
    iterate (\row [1] ++ adjacent (+) row ++ [1]) [1]
</code></pre>
<p>That's really elegant! Let's move on to another example.</p>
<a class="header" href="#quick-sort" id="quick-sort"><h2>Quick-sort</h2></a>
<p>You may have seen this one, but I have included it anyway, because it's so nice. The quick-sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>We pick a single element out of the list, we call it a <em>pivot</em>.</li>
<li>We divide the list into three groups: <em>less than</em> pivot, <em>more than</em> pivot, <em>equal to</em> pivot.</li>
<li>We know the order in which these groups should appear in the final sorted list, so we sort the first two recursively, then put everything together.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, we'll use the first element as the pivot for simplicity. The best choice would be the median, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians">which can be found in O(n) time</a>. Choosing the first element may result in O(n^2) time for some lists, especially nearly sorted ones. However, it will be optimal for randomly ordered lists.</p>
<p>The algorithm as described above can be translated to code nearly exactly (we use <code>List Int</code> for simplicity again, but this can be done generally by taking the <code>&lt;</code> function as another argument):</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func quick-sort : List Int -&gt; List Int =
    \nums
    if (empty? nums) [];
    let (first! nums)            \pivot
    let (filter (&lt; pivot) nums)  \less
    let (filter (== pivot) nums) \equal
    let (filter (&gt; pivot) nums)  \more
    quick-sort less ++ equal ++ quick-sort more
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! The only little code smell is the use of <code>first!</code>, but that can be easily fixed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func quick-sort : List Int -&gt; List Int =
    \nums
    if-none [];
    let-some (first nums)        \pivot
    let (filter (&lt; pivot) nums)  \less
    let (filter (== pivot) nums) \equal
    let (filter (&gt; pivot) nums)  \more
    quick-sort less ++ equal ++ quick-sort more
</code></pre>
<p>Now it's perfect.</p>
<a class="header" href="#integrating" id="integrating"><h2>Integrating</h2></a>
<p>Calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">derivative</a> of a function is quite easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func differentiate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    \f \x
    let 1e-8 \eps
    (f (x + eps) - f (x - eps)) / (2.0 * eps)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we can use it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">differentiate (\x x ^ 2.0)
</code></pre>
<p>The above results in a function that's almost equal to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">\x 2.0 * x
</code></pre>
<p>As it should be.</p>
<p>So, how about calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral">integral</a>? A function like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func integrate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    # ???
</code></pre>
<p>would be really nice.</p>
<p>We are gonna use the standard method to compute the integral, which is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Split the interval [0, x] into many equally-sized chunks.</li>
<li>Create a rectangle above (under) each of the chunks who's height matches the value of the function at that point.</li>
<li>Calculate the area of each of the rectangles.</li>
<li>Sum up those areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't understand the algorithm, consider watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEAk0BHBYCM">this video</a>.</p>
<p>We're gonna express the algorithm using the method of <em>threading</em>. Threading means passing an initial value through a series of transformations. It can be expressed very beautifully using the <code>|&gt;</code> operator. As we know, the <code>|&gt;</code> operator works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(x |&gt; f) = (f x)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to pass a value through a series of functions, we would like to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">x |&gt; f |&gt; g
</code></pre>
<p>But, this would get parenthesised as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">x |&gt; (f |&gt; g)
</code></pre>
<p>which is not what we want.</p>
<p>However, if you type the expression <code>x |&gt; f |&gt; g</code> in Funky, you find that it actually works! This is because <code>|&gt;</code> has another version that works like the function composition operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">(f |&gt; g) = (g . f)
</code></pre>
<p>When threading, we usually write the code like this, for readability:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">x
|&gt; f
|&gt; g
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's get to the integral. First, we're gonna specify the width of each of the rectangles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func integrate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    \f \x
    let 0.001 \w
    # ...
</code></pre>
<p>The width we chose isn't very small, this is for performance reasons: a very small width would result in too many rectangles.</p>
<p>Now we're gonna generate the positions of the individual rectangles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func integrate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    \f \x
    let 0.001 \w
    iterate (+ w) 0.0
    |&gt; take-while (&lt;= x)
    # ...
</code></pre>
<p>We generate an infinite list of <code>w</code>-separated numbers starting from zero, then we cut them at <code>x</code>. Now, we're gonna transform this list into the values of the function at those points:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func integrate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    \f \x
    let 0.001 \w
    iterate (+ w) 0.0
    |&gt; take-while (&lt;= x)
    |&gt; map f
    # ...
</code></pre>
<p>Now we're gonna calculate the areas:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func integrate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    \f \x
    let 0.001 \w
    iterate (+ w) 0.0
    |&gt; take-while (&lt;= x)
    |&gt; map f
    |&gt; map (* w)
    # ...
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, sum them all up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func integrate : (Float -&gt; Float) -&gt; Float -&gt; Float =
    \f \x
    let 0.001 \w
    iterate (+ w) 0.0
    |&gt; take-while (&lt;= x)
    |&gt; map f
    |&gt; map (* w)
    |&gt; sum
</code></pre>
<p>And that's all! The threading pattern is useful in many situations and usually results in a very readable code, so use it when appropriate.</p>

<p>The current idea is that identifiers prefixed with <code>_</code> will be unexported and importing would work similarly to Go's package system. All files in a single directory would be a part of a single package.</p>
<p>Also, a <code>record</code> with unexported fields wouldn't export its constructor and a <code>union</code> with unexported alternatives would not be switchable by the importer.</p>
<a class="header" href="#more-side-effect-interpreters-wanted" id="more-side-effect-interpreters-wanted"><h2>More side-effect interpreters <em>(wanted)</em></h2></a>
<p>No side-effect interpreter is currently fully featured.</p>
<p>Funky aims to be a general purpose language without forgetting about visualizations, GUI, games, and recreational programming. Here are some of the most wanted side-effect interpreters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command line applications with ability to replace shell scripts.</li>
<li>GUI built for visualizations and games first, text editors second.</li>
<li>Web servers.</li>
<li>Erlang/Go-style concurrent distributed programs.</li>

<p>True power will come with the ability to use multiple side-effect interpreters in a single program. GUI &amp; command line, concurrency &amp; web, or all of them together. Not sure how to do it yet, but it's definitely something that wants to happen.</p>
<a class="header" href="#improvements-to-switchcase-planned" id="improvements-to-switchcase-planned"><h2>Improvements to <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code> <em>(planned)</em></h2></a>
<p>The <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code> construct is kinda limited at the moment. You need to list all the alternatives in the same order they are defined.</p>
<p>This construct will be improved to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing alternatives in any order.</li>
<li>A default case + ability to leave out alternatives.</li>
<li>Switching on multiple things simultaneously.</li>
<li>Switching on plain values using <code>==</code>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#the-with-clause-planned" id="the-with-clause-planned"><h2>The <code>with</code> clause <em>(planned)</em></h2></a>
<p>Currently, it's possible to make a <code>sum</code> function of this type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func sum : List Int -&gt; Int
</code></pre>
<p>Or this type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func sum : List Float -&gt; Float
</code></pre>
<p>And also other types that can be summed.</p>
<p>While the implementations will look very similar (or even the same), there's no way to generalize them. Just <code>List a -&gt; a</code> won't work, because there's no way to add arbitrary types.</p>
<p>This is where the <code>with</code> clause comes handy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">with zero : a
with +    : a -&gt; a -&gt; a
func sum  : List a -&gt; a = fold&gt; (+) zero
</code></pre>
<p>This says that the <code>sum</code> function works on all types <code>a</code>, such that there are functions <code>zero</code> and <code>+</code> with the specified types.</p>
<p>The syntax is currently planned as shown - you need to use multiple <code>with</code> clauses to require multiple functions.</p>
<p>Another example would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">with string : a -&gt; String
func string : List a -&gt; String =
    \list
    &quot;[&quot; ++ join &quot;, &quot; (map string list) ++ &quot;]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>With regards to type collisions, the type of the <code>sum</code> function is <code>List a -&gt; a</code>. If you attempted to also define a more specific version, like <code>sum : List Int -&gt; Int</code>, it would fail with a type collision. This is a deliberate design choice to avoid having to select &quot;the most specific&quot; version and confuse everybody and instead have it simple: either it's general, or it's specific.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implicit-functions-considered" id="implicit-functions-considered"><h2>Implicit functions <em>(considered)</em></h2></a>
<p>This feature would make a function be applied automatically when needed. This would usually be useful for automatic type-conversions.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">implicit a -&gt; Maybe a = some
</code></pre>
<p>The definition looks just like a definition of a normal function, except it starts with <code>implicit</code> instead of <code>func</code> and has no name.</p>
<p>This implicit function would enable writing this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">[1, 2, none, 4, 5, none, none]
</code></pre>
<p>instead of this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">[some 1, some 2, none, some 4, some 5, none, none]
</code></pre>
<p>The current idea is that an implicit function would only be applied when the original expression doesn't fit the context and only one implicit function could be applied to a single expression.</p>
<p>Also, defining an implicit function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">implicit A -&gt; B = ...
</code></pre>
<p>would make types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> collide.</p>
<p>So, for example, with the above <code>a -&gt; Maybe a</code> conversion, these functions would collide even though they didn't before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func int : String -&gt; Int
func int : String -&gt; Maybe Int
</code></pre>
<p>This is to avoid confusion and ambiguity.</p>
<p>This feature has a potential for abuse, that's why it's only considered and not planned yet.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-boxany-type-planned" id="the-boxany-type-planned"><h2>The <code>Box</code>/<code>Any</code> type <em>(planned)</em></h2></a>
<p>The <code>Box</code> type (could also be named <code>Any</code>) would be a built-in type with two built-in functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">func pack    : a -&gt; Box
func unpack! : Box -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>unpack!</code> function could possibly have type <code>Box -&gt; Maybe a</code> and be called <code>unpack</code>.</p>
<p>It would make it possible to temporarily escape the type system and allow creating some type-safe constructs not possible without it.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we'd like to make a side-effect interpreter for Erlang/Go-style concurrency. A natural way would be to define a <code>Routine</code> type, something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Routine a =
    halt                           |
    make (Chan a -&gt; Routine a)     |
    send (Chan a) a (Routine a)    |
    recv (Chan a) (a -&gt; Routine a) |
    spawn (Routine a) (Routine a)  |
</code></pre>
<p>This would enable expressing routines that make channels and send and receive values on them. The interpreter would handle actually sending values over the channels.</p>
<p>There's one crucial deficiency: all channels have to be of the same type. The current type system doesn't make it possible to express it any other way. You can try! It can't be done.</p>
<p>Obviously, we'd like to make channels of different types. Here's how the <code>Box</code> type would help:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">union Routine =
    halt                       |
    _make (Box -&gt; Routine)     |
    _send Box Box Routine      |
    _recv Box (Box -&gt; Routine) |
    spawn Routine Routine      |
</code></pre>
<p>Three commands are prefixed with <code>_</code>. This means that they're not meant to be used by the user of this library and the future package system will make sure they're unexported.</p>
<p>The <code>Routine</code> type has also lost it's type variable. It doesn't need it anymore.</p>
<p>Now, this definition allows sending arbitrary values over arbitrary channels, but doesn't guarantee type-safety. However, if we define our own versions of those three commands, we get the type safety back:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">record Chan a = _box : Box

func make : (Chan a -&gt; Routine) -&gt; Routine =
    \fnext
    _make \box-ch
    fnext (Chan box-ch)

func send : Chan a -&gt; a -&gt; Routine -&gt; Routine =
    \ch \x \next
    _send (_box ch) (pack x);
    next

func recv : Chan a -&gt; (a -&gt; Routine) -&gt; Routine =
    \ch \fnext
    _recv (_box ch) \box-x
    fnext (unpack! box-x)
</code></pre>
<p>These functions guarantee type-safe sending and receiving over channels and make it possible to create channels of different types.</p>
<a class="header" href="#partially-apply-secondthird-argument-considered" id="partially-apply-secondthird-argument-considered"><h2>Partially apply second/third/... argument <em>(considered)</em></h2></a>
<p>Currently, we can only partially apply the first argument of a prefix function without making a lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">map sqrt
</code></pre>
<p>To partially apply a second argument, we need to make a lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">\f map f [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>This syntax would make it possible to partially apply the second, third, or any other argument without making a lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-funky">map _ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
